It is designed to be dynamic, organically growing, and learning as you use it.\n- Agent Zero is fully transparent, readable, comprehensible, customizable, and interactive.\n- Agent Zero uses the computer as a tool to accomplish its (your) tasks.\n\n# 💡 Key Features\n\n1. **General-purpose Assistant**\n\n- Agent Zero is not pre-programmed for specific tasks (but can be). It is meant to be a general-purpose personal assistant. Give it a task, and it will gather information, execute commands and code, cooperate with other agent instances, and do its best to accomplish it.\n- It has a persistent memory, allowing it to memorize previous solutions, code, facts, instructions, etc., to solve tasks faster and more reliably in the future.\n\n![Agent 0 Working](/docs/res/ui-screen-2.png)\n\n2. **Computer as a Tool**\n\n- Agent Zero uses the operating system as a tool to accomplish its tasks. It has no single-purpose tools pre-programmed. Instead, it can write its own code and use the terminal to create and use its own tools as needed.\n- The only default tools in its arsenal are online search, memory features, communication (with the user and other agents), and code/terminal execution. Everything else is created by the agent itself or can be extended by the user.\n- Tool usage functionality has been developed from scratch to be the most compatible and reliable, even with very small models.\n- **Default Tools:** Agent Zero includes tools like knowledge, webpage content, code execution, and communication.\n- **Creating Custom Tools:** Extend Agent Zero's functionality by creating your own custom tools.\n- **Instruments:** Instruments are a new type of tool that allow you to create custom functions and procedures that can be called by Agent Zero.\n\n3. **Multi-agent Cooperation**\n\n- Every agent has a superior agent giving it tasks and instructions. Every agent then reports back to its superior.\n- In the case of the first agent in the chain (Agent 0), the superior is the human user; the agent sees no difference.\n- Every agent can create its subordinate agent to help break down and solve subtasks. This helps all agents keep their context clean and focused.\n\n![Multi-agent](docs/res/physics.png)\n![Multi-agent 2](docs/res/physics-2.png)\n\n4. **Completely Customizable and Extensible**\n\n- Almost nothing in this framework is hard-coded. Nothing is hidden. Everything can be extended or changed by the user.\n- The whole behavior is defined by a system prompt in the **prompts/default/agent.system.md** file. Change this prompt and change the framework dramatically.\n- The framework does not guide or limit the agent in any way. There are no hard-coded rails that agents have to follow.\n- Every prompt, every small message template sent to the agent in its communication loop can be found in the **prompts/** folder and changed.\n- Every default tool can be found in the **python/tools/** folder and changed or copied to create new predefined tools.\n\n![Prompts](/docs/res/prompts.png)\n\n5. **Communication is Key**\n\n- Give your agent a proper system prompt and instructions, and it can do miracles.\n- Agents can communicate with their superiors and subordinates, asking questions, giving instructions, and providing guidance. Instruct your agents in the system prompt on how to communicate effectively.\n- The terminal interface is real-time streamed and interactive. You can stop and intervene at any point. If you see your agent heading in the wrong direction, just stop and tell it right away.\n- There is a lot of freedom in this framework. You can instruct your agents to regularly report back to superiors asking for permission to continue. You can instruct them to use point-scoring systems when deciding when to delegate subtasks. Superiors can double-check subordinates' results and dispute. The possibilities are endless.\n\n## 🚀 Things you can build with Agent Zero\n\n- **Development Projects** - `\"Create a React dashboard with real-time data visualization\"`\n\n- **Data Analysis** - `\"Analyze last quarter's NVIDIA sales data and create trend reports\"`\n\n- **Content Creation** - `\"Write a technical blog post about microservices\"`\n\n- **System Admin** - `\"Set up a monitoring system for our web servers\"`\n\n- **Research** - `\"Gather and summarize five recent AI papers about CoT prompting\"`\n\n# Hacking Edition\n- Agent Zero also offers a Hacking Edition based on Kali linux with modified prompts for cybersecurity tasks\n- The setup is the same as the regular version, just use the frdel/agent-zero-run:hacking image instead of frdel/agent-zero-run\n\n\n# ⚙️ Installation\n\nClick to open a video to learn how to install Agent Zero:\n\n[![Easy Installation guide](/docs/res/easy_ins_vid.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1_peV8szf8)\n\nA detailed setup guide for Windows, macOS, and Linux with a video can be found in the Agent Zero Documentation at [this page](./docs/installation.md).\n\n### ⚡ Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Pull and run with Docker\n\ndocker pull frdel/agent-zero-run\ndocker run -p 50001:80 frdel/agent-zero-run\n\n# Visit http://localhost:50001 to start\n```\n\n## 🐳 Fully Dockerized, with Speech-to-Text and TTS\n\n![Settings](docs/res/settings-page-ui.png)\n\n- Customizable settings allow users to tailor the agent's behavior and responses to their needs.\n- The Web UI output is very clean, fluid, colorful, readable, and interactive; nothing is hidden.\n- You can load or save chats directly within the Web UI.\n- The same output you see in the terminal is automatically saved to an HTML file in **logs/** folder for every session.\n\n![Time example](/docs/res/time_example.jpg)\n\n- Agent output is streamed in real-time, allowing users to read along and intervene at any time.\n- No coding is required; only prompting and communication skills are necessary.\n- With a solid system prompt, the framework is reliable even with small models, including precise tool usage.\n\n## 👀 Keep in Mind\n\n1. **Agent Zero Can Be Dangerous!**\n\n- With proper instruction, Agent Zero is capable of many things, even potentially dangerous actions concerning your computer, data, or accounts. Always run Agent Zero in an isolated environment (like Docker) and be careful what you wish for.\n\n2. **Agent Zero Is Prompt-based.**\n\n- The whole framework is guided by the **prompts/** folder. Agent guidelines, tool instructions, messages, utility AI functions, it's all there.\n\n\n## 📚 Read the Documentation\n\n| Page | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [Installation](./docs/installation.md) | Installation, setup and configuration |\n| [Usage](./docs/usage.md) | Basic and advanced usage |\n| [Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) | System design and components |\n| [Contributing](./docs/contribution.md) | How to contribute |\n| [Troubleshooting](./docs/troubleshooting.md) | Common issues and their solutions |\n\n## Coming soon\n\n- **MCP**\n- **Knowledge and RAG Tools**\n\n## 🎯 Changelog\n\n### v0.8.4.1\n- Various bugfixes related to context management\n- Message formatting improvements\n- Scheduler improvements\n- New model provider\n- Input tool fix\n- Compatibility and stability improvements\n\n### v0.8.4\n[Release video](https://youtu.be/QBh_h_D_E24)\n\n- **Remote access (mobile)**\n\n### v0.8.3.1\n[Release video](https://youtu.be/AGNpQ3_GxFQ)\n\n- **Automatic embedding**\n\n\n### v0.8.3\n[Release video](https://youtu.be/bPIZo0poalY)\n\n- ***Planning and scheduling***\n\n### v0.8.2\n[Release video](https://youtu.be/xMUNynQ9x6Y)\n\n- **Multitasking in terminal**\n- **Chat names**\n\n### v0.8.1\n[Release video](https://youtu.be/quv145buW74)\n\n- **Browser Agent**\n- **UX Improvements**\n\n### v0.8\n[Release video](https://youtu.be/cHDCCSr1YRI)\n\n- **Docker Runtime**\n- **New Messages History and Summarization System**\n- **Agent Behavior Change and Management**\n- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT)**\n- **Settings Page in Web UI**\n- **SearXNG Integration Replacing Perplexity + DuckDuckGo**\n- **File Browser Functionality**\n- **KaTeX Math Visualization Support**\n- **In-chat File Attachments**\n\n### v0.7\n[Release video](https://youtu.be/U_Gl0NPalKA)\n\n- **Automatic Memory**\n- **UI Improvements**\n- **Instruments**\n- **Extensions Framework**\n- **Reflection Prompts**\n- **Bug Fixes**\n\n## 🤝 Community and Support\n\n- [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/B8KZKNsPpj) for live discussions or [visit our Skool Community](https://www.skool.com/agent-zero).\n- [Follow our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AgentZeroFW) for hands-on explanations and tutorials\n- [Report Issues](https://github.com/frdel/agent-zero/issues) for bug fixes and features\n"

        "content": "# Architecture Overview\nAgent Zero is built on a flexible and modular architecture designed for extensibility and customization. This section outlines the key components and the interactions between them.\n\n## System Architecture\nThis simplified diagram illustrates the hierarchical relationship between agents and their interaction with tools, extensions, instruments, prompts, memory and knowledge base.\n\n![Agent Zero Architecture](res/arch-01.svg)\n\nThe user or Agent 0 is at the top of the hierarchy, delegating tasks to subordinate agents, which can further delegate to other agents. Each agent can utilize tools and access the shared assets (prompts, memory, knowledge, extensions and instruments) to perform its tasks.\n\n## Runtime Architecture\nAgent Zero's runtime architecture is built around Docker containers:\n\n1. **Host System (your machine)**:\n   - Requires only Docker and a web browser\n   - Runs Docker Desktop or Docker Engine\n   - Handles container orchestration\n\n2. **Runtime Container**:\n   - Houses the complete Agent Zero framework\n   - Manages the Web UI and API endpoints\n   - Handles all core functionalities including code execution\n   - Provides a standardized environment across all platforms\n\nThis architecture ensures:\n- Consistent environment across platforms\n- Simplified deployment and updates\n- Enhanced security through containerization\n- Reduced dependency requirements on host systems\n- Flexible deployment options for advanced users\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The legacy approach of running Agent Zero directly on the host system (using Python, Conda, etc.) \n> is still possible but requires Remote Function Calling (RFC) configuration through the Settings \n> page. See [Full Binaries Installation](installation.md#in-depth-guide-for-full-binaries-installation) \n> for detailed instructions.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Directory Structure\n| Directory | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `/docker` | Docker-related files for runtime container |\n| `/docs` | Documentation files and guides |\n| `/instruments` | Custom scripts and tools for runtime environment |\n| `/knowledge` | Knowledge base storage |\n| `/logs` | HTML CLI-style chat logs |\n| `/memory` | Persistent agent memory storage |\n| `/prompts` | System and tool prompts |\n| `/python` | Core Python codebase: |\n| `/api` | API endpoints and interfaces |\n| `/extensions` | Modular extensions |\n| `/helpers` | Utility functions |\n| `/tools` | Tool implementations |\n| `/tmp` | Temporary runtime data |\n| `/webui` | Web interface components: |\n| `/css` | Stylesheets |\n| `/js` | JavaScript modules |\n| `/public` | Static assets |\n| `/work_dir` | Working directory |\n\n### Key Files\n| File | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `.env` | Environment configuration |\n| `agent.py` | Core agent implementation |\n| `example.env` | Configuration template |\n| `initialize.py` | Framework initialization |\n| `models.py` | Model providers and configs |\n| `preload.py` | Pre-initialization routines |\n| `prepare.py` | Environment preparation |\n| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |\n| `run_cli.py` | CLI launcher |\n| `run_ui.py` | Web UI launcher |\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> When using the Docker runtime container, these directories are mounted \n> within the `/a0` volume for data persistence until the container is restarted or deleted.\n\n## Core Components\nAgent Zero's architecture revolves around the following key components:\n\n### 1. Agents\nThe core actors within the framework. Agents receive instructions, reason, make decisions, and utilize tools to achieve their objectives. Agents operate within a hierarchical structure, with superior agents delegating tasks to subordinate agents.\n\n#### Agent Hierarchy and Communication\nAgent Zero employs a hierarchical agent structure, where a top-level agent (often the user) can delegate tasks to subordinate agents. This hierarchy allows for the efficient breakdown of complex tasks into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.\n\nCommunication flows between agents through messages, which are structured according to the prompt templates. These messages typically include:\n\n| Argument | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Thoughts:` | The agent's Chain of Thought and planning process |\n| `Tool name:` | The specific tool used by the agent |\n| `Responses or queries:` | Results, feedback or queries from tools or other agents |\n\n#### Interaction Flow\nA typical interaction flow within Agent Zero might look like this:\n\n![Interaction Flow](res/flow-01.svg)\n\n1. The user provides an instruction to Agent 0\n2. Agent 0 initializes VectorDB and access memory\n3. Agent 0 analyzes the instruction and formulates a plan using `thoughts` argument, possibly involving the use of tools or the creation of sub-agents\n4. If necessary, Agent 0 delegates sub-tasks to subordinate agents\n5. Agents use tools to perform actions, both providing arguments and responses or queries\n6. Agents communicate results and feedback back up the hierarchy\n7. Agent 0 provides the final response to the user\n\n### 2. Tools\nTools are functionalities that agents can leverage. These can include anything from web search and code execution to interacting with APIs or controlling external software. Agent Zero provides a mechanism for defining and integrating both built-in and custom tools.\n\n#### Built-in Tools\nAgent Zero comes with a set of built-in tools designed to help agents perform tasks efficiently:\n\n| Tool | Function |\n| --- | --- |\n| behavior_adjustment | Agent Zero use this tool to change its behavior according to a prior request from the user.\n| call_subordinate | Allows agents to delegate tasks to subordinate agents |\n| code_execution_tool | Allows agents to execute Python, Node.js, and Shell code in the terminal |\n| input | Allows agents to use the keyboard to interact with an active shell |\n| knowledge_tool | Enables agents to retrieve information from memory, knowledge base or online external sources |\n| response_tool | Allows agents to output a response |\n| memory_tool | Enables agents to save, load, delete and forget information from memory |\n| webpage_content_tool | Enables agents to fetch and analyze the text content of webpages |\n\n#### Knowledge Tool\nThe `knowledge_tool` uses SearXNG to search the web and retrieve information. It can also search the local knowledge base and memory for relevant information. The tool returns a summary of the information, which can be used by the agent to make decisions or answer questions.\n\n#### SearXNG Integration\nAgent Zero has integrated SearXNG as its primary search tool, replacing the previous knowledge tools (Perplexity and DuckDuckGo). This integration enhances the agent's ability to retrieve information while ensuring user privacy and customization.\n\n- Privacy-Focused Search\nSearXNG is an open-source metasearch engine that allows users to search multiple sources without tracking their queries. This integration ensures that user data remains private and secure while accessing a wide range of information.\n\n- Enhanced Search Capabilities\nThe integration provides access to various types of content, including images, videos, and news articles, allowing users to gather comprehensive information on any topic.\n\n- Fallback Mechanism\nIn cases where SearXNG might not return satisfactory results, Agent Zero can be configured to fall back on other sources or methods, ensuring that users always have access to information.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The Knowledge Tool is designed to work seamlessly with both online searches through \n> SearXNG and local knowledge base queries, providing a comprehensive information \n> retrieval system.\n\n#### Custom Tools\nUsers can create custom tools to extend Agent Zero's capabilities. Custom tools can be integrated into the framework by defining a tool specification, which includes the tool's prompt to be placed in `/prompts/$FOLDERNAME/agent.system.tool.$TOOLNAME.md`, as detailed below.\n\n1. Create `agent.system.tool.$TOOL_NAME.md` in `prompts/$SUBDIR`\n2. Add reference in `agent.system.tools.md`\n3. If needed, implement tool class in `python/tools` using `Tool` base class\n4. Follow existing patterns for consistency\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Tools are always present in system prompt, so you should keep them to minimum. \n> To save yourself some tokens, use the [Instruments module](#adding-instruments) \n> to call custom scripts or functions.\n\n### 3. Memory System\nThe memory system is a critical component of Agent Zero, enabling the agent to learn and adapt from past interactions. It operates on a hybrid model where part of the memory is managed automatically by the framework while users can also manually input and extract information.\n\n#### Memory Structure\nThe memory is categorized into four distinct areas:\n- **Storage and retrieval** of user-provided information (e.g., names, API keys)\n- **Fragments**: Contains pieces of information from previous conversations, updated automatically\n- **Solutions**: Stores successful solutions from past interactions for future reference\n- **Metadata**: Each memory entry includes metadata (IDs, timestamps), enabling efficient filtering and searching based on specific criteria\n\n#### Messages History and Summarization\n\nAgent Zero employs a sophisticated message history and summarization system to maintain context effectively while optimizing memory usage. This system dynamically manages the information flow, ensuring relevant details are readily available while efficiently handling the constraints of context windows.\n\n- **Context Extraction:** The system identifies key information from previous messages that are vital for ongoing discussions. This process mirrors how humans recall important memories, allowing less critical details to fade.\n- **Summarization Process:** Using natural language processing through the utility model, Agent Zero condenses the extracted information into concise summaries. By summarizing past interactions, Agent Zero can quickly recall important facts about the whole chat, leading to more appropriate responses.\n- **Contextual Relevance:** The summarized context is prioritized based on its relevance to the current topic, ensuring users receive the most pertinent information.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n- **Message Summaries**: Individual messages are summarized using a structured format that captures key information while reducing token usage.\n- **Dynamic Compression**: The system employs an intelligent compression strategy:\n  - Recent messages remain in their original form for immediate context.\n  - Older messages are gradually compressed into more concise summaries.\n  - Multiple compression levels allow for efficient context window usage.\n  - Original messages are preserved separately from summaries.\n- **Context Window Optimization**:\n  - Acts as a near-infinite short-term memory for single conversations.\n  - Dynamically adjusts compression ratios based on available space and settings.\n- **Bulk and Topic Summarization**:\n  - Groups related messages into thematic chunks for better organization.\n  - Generates concise summaries of multiple messages while preserving key context.\n  - Enables efficient navigation of long conversation histories.\n  - Maintains semantic connections between related topics.\n\nBy dynamically adjusting context windows and summarizing past interactions, Agent Zero enhances both efficiency and user experience. This innovation not only reflects the framework's commitment to being dynamic and user-centric, but also draws inspiration from human cognitive processes, making AI interactions more relatable and effective. Just as humans forget trivial details, Agent Zero intelligently condenses information to enhance communication.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> To maximize the effectiveness of context summarization, users should provide clear and specific instructions during interactions. This helps Agent Zero understand which details are most important to retain.\n\n### 4. Prompts\nThe `prompts` directory contains various Markdown files that control agent behavior and communication. The most important file is `agent.system.main.md`, which acts as a central hub, referencing other prompt files.\n\n#### Core Prompt Files\n| Prompt File | Description |\n|---|---|\n| agent.system.main.role.md | Defines the agent's overall role and capabilities |\n| agent.system.main.communication.md | Specifies how the agent should communicate |\n| agent.system.main.solving.md | Describes the agent's approach to tasks |\n| agent.system.main.tips.md | Provides additional tips or guidance |\n| agent.system.main.behaviour.md | Controls dynamic behavior adjustments and rules |\n| agent.system.main.environment.md | Defines the runtime environment context |\n| agent.system.tools.md | Organizes and calls the individual tool prompt files |\n| agent.system.tool.*.md | Individual tool prompt files |\n\n#### Prompt Organization\n- **Default Prompts**: Located in `prompts/default/`, serve as the base configuration\n- **Custom Prompts**: Can be placed in custom subdirectories (e.g., `prompts/my-custom/`)\n- **Behavior Files**: Stored in memory as `behaviour.md`, containing dynamic rules\n- **Tool Prompts**: Organized in tool-specific files for modularity\n\n#### Custom Prompts\n1. Create directory in `prompts/` (e.g., `my-custom-prompts`)\n2. Copy and modify needed files from `prompts/default/`\n3. Agent Zero will merge your custom files with the default ones\n4. Select your custom prompts in the Settings page (Agent Config section)\n\n#### Dynamic Behavior System\n- **Behavior Adjustment**: \n  - Agents can modify their behavior in real-time based on user instructions\n  - Behavior changes are automatically integrated into the system prompt\n  - Behavioral rules are merged intelligently, avoiding duplicates and conflicts\n\n- **Behavior Management Components**:\n  - `behaviour_adjustment.py`: Core tool for updating agent behavior\n  - `_20_behaviour_prompt.py`: Extension that injects behavior rules into system prompt\n  - Custom rules stored in the agent's memory directory as `behaviour.md`\n\n- **Behavior Update Process**:\n  1. User requests behavior changes (e.g., \"respond in UK English\")\n  2. System identifies behavioral instructions in conversation\n  3. New rules are merged with existing ruleset\n  4. Updated behavior is immediately applied\n\n![Behavior Adjustment](res/ui-behavior-change-chat.png)\n\n- **Integration with System Prompt**:\n  - Behavior rules are injected at the start of the system prompt\n  - Rules are formatted in a structured markdown format\n  - Changes are applied without disrupting other components\n  - Maintains separation between core functionality and behavioral rules\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> You can customize any of these files. Agent Zero will use the files in your custom `prompts_subdir` \n> if they exist, otherwise, it will fall back to the files in `prompts/default`.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The behavior system allows for dynamic adjustments without modifying the base prompt files.\n> Changes made through behavior rules persist across sessions while maintaining the core functionality.\n\n### 5. Knowledge\nKnowledge refers to the user-provided information and data that agents can leverage:\n\n- **Custom Knowledge**: Add files to `/knowledge/custom/main` directory manually or through the \"Import Knowledge\" button in the UI\n  - Supported formats: `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.csv`, `.html`, `.json`, `.md`\n  - Automatically imported and indexed\n  - Expandable format support\n\n- **Knowledge Base**: \n  - Can include PDFs, databases, books, documentation\n  - `/docs` folder automatically added\n  - Used for answering questions and decision-making\n  - Supports RAG-augmented tasks\n\n### 6. Instruments\nInstruments provide a way to add custom functionalities to Agent Zero without adding to the token count of the system prompt:\n- Stored in long-term memory of Agent Zero\n- Unlimited number of instruments available\n- Recalled when needed by the agent\n- Can modify agent behavior by introducing new procedures\n- Function calls or scripts to integrate with other systems\n- Scripts are run inside the Docker Container\n\n#### Adding Instruments\n1. Create folder in `instruments/custom` (no spaces in name)\n2. Add `.md` description file for the interface\n3. Add `.sh` script (or other executable) for implementation\n4. The agent will automatically detect and use the instrument\n\n### 7. Extensions\nExtensions are a powerful feature of Agent Zero, designed to keep the main codebase clean and organized while allowing for greater flexibility and modularity.\n\n#### Structure\nExtensions can be found in `python/extensions` directory:\n- **Folder Organization**: Extensions are stored in designated subfolders corresponding to different aspects of the agent's message loop\n- **Execution Order**: Files are executed in alphabetical order for predictable behavior\n- **Naming Convention**: Files start with numbers to control execution order\n- **Modularity**: Each extension focuses on a specific functionality\n\n#### Types\n- **Message Loop Prompts**: Handle system messages and history construction\n- **Memory Management**: Handle recall and solution memorization\n- **System Integration**: Manage interaction with external systems\n\n#### Adding Extensions\n1. Create Python file in appropriate `python/extensions` subfolder\n2. Follow naming convention for execution order (start with number)\n3. Implement functionality following existing patterns\n4. Ensure compatibility with main system\n5. Test thoroughly before deployment\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> Consider contributing valuable custom components to the main repository.\n> See [Contributing](contribution.md) for more information."

        "content": "# Users installation guide for Windows, macOS and Linux\n\nClick to open a video to learn how to install Agent Zero:\n\n[![Easy Installation guide](/docs/res/easy_ins_vid.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1_peV8szf8)\n\nThe following user guide provides instructions for installing and running Agent Zero using Docker, which is the primary runtime environment for the framework. For developers and contributors, we also provide instructions for setting up the [full development environment](#in-depth-guide-for-full-binaries-installation).\n\n\n## Windows, macOS and Linux Setup Guide\n\n\n1. **Install Docker Desktop:** \n- Docker Desktop provides the runtime environment for Agent Zero, ensuring consistent behavior and security across platforms\n- The entire framework runs within a Docker container, providing isolation and easy deployment\n- Available as a user-friendly GUI application for all major operating systems\n\n1.1. Go to the download page of Docker Desktop [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). If the link does not work, just search the web for \"docker desktop download\".\n\n1.2. Download the version for your operating system. For Windows users, the Intel/AMD version is the main download button.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-8.png\" alt=\"docker download\" width=\"200\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> **Linux Users:** You can install either Docker Desktop or docker-ce (Community Edition). \n> For Docker Desktop, follow the instructions for your specific Linux distribution [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/). \n> For docker-ce, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).\n>\n> If you're using docker-ce, you'll need to add your user to the `docker` group:\n> ```bash\n> sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n> ```\n> Log out and back in, then run:\n> ```bash\n> docker login\n> ```\n\n1.3. Run the installer with default settings. On macOS, drag and drop the application to your Applications folder.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-9.png\" alt=\"docker install\" width=\"300\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-10.png\" alt=\"docker install\" width=\"300\"/>\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-12.png\" alt=\"docker install\" width=\"300\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n1.4. Once installed, launch Docker Desktop: \n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-11.png\" alt=\"docker installed\" height=\"100\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-13.png\" alt=\"docker installed\" height=\"100\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> **macOS Configuration:** In Docker Desktop's preferences (Docker menu) → Settings → \n> Advanced, enable \"Allow the default Docker socket to be used (requires password).\"\n\n![docker socket macOS](res/setup/macsocket.png)\n\n2. **Run Agent Zero:**\n\n- Note: Agent Zero also offers a Hacking Edition based on Kali linux with modified prompts for cybersecurity tasks. The setup is the same as the regular version, just use the frdel/agent-zero-run:hacking image instead of frdel/agent-zero-run.\n\n2.1. Pull the Agent Zero Docker image:\n- Search for `frdel/agent-zero-run` in Docker Desktop\n- Click the `Pull` button\n- The image will be downloaded to your machine in a few minutes\n\n![docker pull](res/setup/1-docker-image-search.png)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Alternatively, run the following command in your terminal:\n>\n> ```bash\n> docker pull frdel/agent-zero-run\n> ```\n\n2.2. Create a data directory for persistence:\n- Choose or create a directory on your machine where you want to store Agent Zero's data\n- This can be any location you prefer (e.g., `C:/agent-zero-data` or `/home/user/agent-zero-data`)\n- This directory will contain all your Agent Zero files, like the legacy root folder structure:\n  - `/memory` - Agent's memory and learned information\n  - `/knowledge` - Knowledge base\n  - `/instruments` - Instruments and functions\n  - `/prompts` - Prompt files\n  - `/work_dir` - Working directory\n  - `.env` - Your API keys\n  - `settings.json` - Your Agent Zero settings\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Choose a location that's easy to access and backup. All your Agent Zero data \n> will be directly accessible in this directory.\n\n2.3. Run the container:\n- In Docker Desktop, go back to the \"Images\" tab\n- Click the `Run` button next to the `frdel/agent-zero-run` image\n- Open the \"Optional settings\" menu\n- Set the port to `0` in the second \"Host port\" field (for automatic port assignment)\n\nOptionally you can map local folders for file persistence:\n- Under \"Volumes\", configure:\n  - Host path: Your chosen directory (e.g., `C:\\agent-zero-data`)\n  - Container path: `/a0`\n\n![docker port mapping](res/setup/3-docker-port-mapping.png)\n\n- Click the `Run` button in the \"Images\" tab.\n- The container will start and show in the \"Containers\" tab\n\n![docker containers](res/setup/4-docker-container-started.png)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Alternatively, run the following command in your terminal:\n> ```bash\n> docker run -p $PORT:80 -v /path/to/your/data:/a0 frdel/agent-zero-run\n> ```\n> - Replace `$PORT` with the port you want to use (e.g., `50080`)\n> - Replace `/path/to/your/data` with your chosen directory path\n\n2.4. Access the Web UI:\n- The framework will take a few seconds to initialize and the Docker logs will look like the image below.\n- Find the mapped port in Docker Desktop (shown as `<PORT>:80`) or click the port right under the container ID as shown in the image below\n\n![docker logs](res/setup/5-docker-click-to-open.png)\n\n- Open `http://localhost:<PORT>` in your browser\n- The Web UI will open. Agent Zero is ready for configuration!\n\n![docker ui](res/setup/6-docker-a0-running.png)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> You can also access the Web UI by clicking the ports right under the container ID in Docker Desktop.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> After starting the container, you'll find all Agent Zero files in your chosen \n> directory. You can access and edit these files directly on your machine, and \n> the changes will be immediately reflected in the running container.\n\n3. Configure Agent Zero\n- Refer to the following sections for a full guide on how to configure Agent Zero.\n\n## Settings Configuration\nAgent Zero provides a comprehensive settings interface to customize various aspects of its functionality. Access the settings by clicking the \"Settings\"button with a gear icon in the sidebar.\n\n### Agent Configuration\n- **Prompts Subdirectory:** Choose the subdirectory within `/prompts` for agent behavior customization. The 'default' directory contains the standard prompts.\n- **Memory Subdirectory:** Select the subdirectory for agent memory storage, allowing separation between different instances.\n- **Knowledge Subdirectory:** Specify the location of custom knowledge files to enhance the agent's understanding.\n\n![settings](res/setup/settings/1-agentConfig.png)\n\n### Chat Model Settings\n- **Provider:** Select the chat model provider (e.g., Ollama)\n- **Model Name:** Choose the specific model (e.g., llama3.2)\n- **Temperature:** Adjust response randomness (0 for deterministic, higher values for more creative responses)\n- **Context Length:** Set the maximum token limit for context window\n- **Context Window Space:** Configure how much of the context window is dedicated to chat history\n\n![chat model settings](res/setup/settings/2-chat-model.png)\n\n### Utility Model Configuration\n- **Provider & Model:** Select a smaller, faster model for utility tasks like memory organization and summarization\n- **Temperature:** Adjust the determinism of utility responses\n\n### Embedding Model Settings\n- **Provider:** Choose the embedding model provider (e.g., OpenAI)\n- **Model Name:** Select the specific embedding model (e.g., text-embedding-3-small)\n\n### Speech to Text Options\n- **Model Size:** Choose the speech recognition model size\n- **Language Code:** Set the primary language for voice recognition\n- **Silence Settings:** Configure silence threshold, duration, and timeout parameters for voice input\n\n### API Keys\n- Configure API keys for various service providers directly within the Web UI\n- Click `Save` to confirm your settings\n\n### Authentication\n- **UI Login:** Set username for web interface access\n- **UI Password:** Configure password for web interface security\n- **Root Password:** Manage Docker container root password for SSH access\n\n![settings](res/setup/settings/3-auth.png)\n\n### Development Settings\n- **RFC Parameters (local instances only):** configure URLs and ports for remote function calls between instances\n- **RFC Password:** Configure password for remote function calls\nLearn more about Remote Function Calls and their purpose [here](#7-configure-agent-zero-rfc).\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Always keep your API keys and passwords secure.\n\n# Choosing Your LLMs\nThe Settings page is the control center for selecting the Large Language Models (LLMs) that power Agent Zero.  You can choose different LLMs for different roles:\n\n| LLM Role | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `chat_llm` | This is the primary LLM used for conversations and generating responses. |\n| `utility_llm` | This LLM handles internal tasks like summarizing messages, managing memory, and processing internal prompts.  Using a smaller, less expensive model here can improve efficiency. |\n| `embedding_llm` | This LLM is responsible for generating embeddings used for memory retrieval and knowledge base lookups. Changing the `embedding_llm` will re-index all of A0's memory. |\n\n**How to Change:**\n1. Open Settings page in the Web UI.\n2. Choose the provider for the LLM for each role (Chat model, Utility model, Embedding model) and write the model name.\n3. Click \"Save\" to apply the changes.\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Changing the `embedding_llm` will re-index all the memory and knowledge, and \n> requires clearing the `memory` folder to avoid errors, as the embeddings can't be \n> mixed in the vector database. Note that this will DELETE ALL of Agent Zero's memory.\n\n## Installing and Using Ollama (Local Models)\nIf you're interested in Ollama, which is a powerful tool that allows you to run various large language models locally, here's how to install and use it:\n\n#### First step: installation\n**On Windows:**\n\nDownload Ollama from the official website and install it on your machine.\n\n<button>[Download Ollama Setup](https://ollama.com/download/OllamaSetup.exe)</button>\n\n**On macOS:**\n```\nbrew install ollama\n```\nOtherwise choose macOS installer from the [official website](https://ollama.com/).\n\n**On Linux:**\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n**Finding Model Names:**\nVisit the [Ollama model library](https://ollama.com/library) for a list of available models and their corresponding names.  The format is usually `provider/model-name` (or just `model-name` in some cases).\n\n#### Second step: pulling the model\n**On Windows, macOS, and Linux:**\n```\nollama pull <model-name>\n```\n\n1. Replace `<model-name>` with the name of the model you want to use.  For example, to pull the Mistral Large model, you would use the command `ollama pull mistral-large`.\n\n2. A CLI message should confirm the model download on your system\n\n#### Selecting your model within Agent Zero\n1. Once you've downloaded your model(s), you must select it in the Settings page of the GUI. \n\n2. Within the Chat model, Utility model, or Embedding model section, choose Ollama as provider.\n\n3. Write your model code as expected by Ollama, in the format `llama3.2` or `qwen2.5:7b`\n\n4. Click `Save` to confirm your settings.\n\n![ollama](res/setup/settings/4-local-models.png)\n\n#### Managing your downloaded models\nOnce you've downloaded some models, you might want to check which ones you have available or remove any you no longer need.\n\n- **Listing downloaded models:** \n  To see a list of all the models you've downloaded, use the command:\n  ```\n  ollama list\n  ```\n- **Removing a model:**\n  If you need to remove a downloaded model, you can use the `ollama rm` command followed by the model name:\n  ```\n  ollama rm <model-name>\n  ```\n\n\n- Experiment with different model combinations to find the balance of performance and cost that best suits your needs. E.g., faster and lower latency LLMs will help, and you can also use `faiss_gpu` instead of `faiss_cpu` for the memory.\n\n## Using Agent Zero on your mobile device\nAgent Zero's Web UI is accessible from any device on your network through the Docker container:\n\n1. The Docker container automatically exposes the Web UI on all network interfaces\n2. Find the mapped port in Docker Desktop:\n   - Look under the container name (usually in the format `<PORT>:80`)\n   - For example, if you see `32771:80`, your port is `32771`\n3. Access the Web UI from any device using:\n   - Local access: `http://localhost:<PORT>`\n   - Network access: `http://<YOUR_COMPUTER_IP>:<PORT>`\n\n> [!TIP]\n> - Your computer's IP address is usually in the format `192.168.x.x` or `10.0.x.x`\n> - You can find your external IP address by running `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux/Mac)\n> - The port is automatically assigned by Docker unless you specify one\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you're running Agent Zero directly on your system (legacy approach) instead of \n> using Docker, you'll need to configure the host manually in `run_ui.py` to run on all interfaces using `host=\"0.0.0.0\"`.\n\nFor developers or users who need to run Agent Zero directly on their system,see the [In-Depth Guide for Full Binaries Installation](#in-depth-guide-for-full-binaries-installation).\n\n# How to update Agent Zero\n\n1. **If you come from the previous version of Agent Zero:**\n- Your data is safely stored across various directories and files inside the Agent Zero folder.\n- To update to the new Docker runtime version, you might want to backup the following files and directories:\n  - `/memory` - Agent's memory\n  - `/knowledge` - Custom knowledge base (if you imported any custom knowledge files)\n  - `/instruments` - Custom instruments and functions (if you created any custom)\n  - `/tmp/settings.json` - Your Agent Zero settings\n  - `/tmp/chats/` - Your chat history\n- Once you have saved these files and directories, you can proceed with the Docker runtime [installation instructions above](#windows-macos-and-linux-setup-guide) setup guide.\n- Reach for the folder where you saved your data and copy it to the new Agent Zero folder set during the installation process.\n- Agent Zero will automatically detect your saved data and use it across memory, knowledge, instruments, prompts and settings.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> If you have issues loading your settings, you can try to delete the `/tmp/settings.json` file and let Agent Zero generate a new one.\n> The same goes for chats in `/tmp/chats/`, they might be incompatible with the new version\n\n2. **Update Process (Docker Desktop)**\n- Go to Docker Desktop and stop the container from the \"Containers\" tab\n- Right-click and select \"Remove\" to remove the container\n- Go to \"Images\" tab and remove the `frdel/agent-zero-run` image or click the three dots to pull the difference and update the Docker image.\n\n![docker delete image](res/setup/docker-delete-image-1.png)\n\n- Search and pull the new image if you chose to remove it\n- Run the new container with the same volume settings as the old one\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Make sure to use the same volume mount path when running the new\n> container to preserve your data. The exact path depends on where you stored\n> your Agent Zero data directory (the chosen directory on your machine).\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Alternatively, run the following commands in your terminal:\n>\n> ```bash\n> # Stop the current container\n> docker stop agent-zero\n>\n> # Remove the container (data is safe in the folder)\n> docker rm agent-zero\n>\n> # Remove the old image\n> docker rmi frdel/agent-zero-run\n>\n> # Pull the latest image\n> docker pull frdel/agent-zero-run\n>\n> # Run new container with the same volume mount\n> docker run -p $PORT:80 -v /path/to/your/data:/a0 frdel/agent-zero-run\n> ```\n\n3. **Full Binaries**\n- Using Git/GitHub: Pull the latest version of the Agent Zero repository. \n- The custom knowledge, solutions, memory, and other data will get ignored, so you don't need to worry about losing any of your custom data. The same goes for your .env file with all of your API keys and settings.json.\n\n> [!WARNING]  \n> - If you update manually, beware: save your .env file with the API keys, and look for new dependencies in requirements.txt. \n> - If any changes are made to the requirements of the updated version, you have to execute this command inside the a0 conda env after activating it:\n> ```bash\n> pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# In-Depth Guide for Full Binaries Installation\n- Agent Zero is a framework. It's made to be customized, edited, enhanced. Therefore you need to install the necessary components to run it when downloading its full binaries. This guide will help you to do so.\n- The following step by step instructions can be followed along with a video for this tutorial on how to make Agent Zero work with its full development environment.\n\n[![Video](res/setup/thumb_play.png)](https://youtu.be/8H7mFsvxKYQ)\n\n## Reminders:\n1. There's no need to install Python, Conda will manage that for you.\n2. You don't necessarily need API keys: Agent Zero can run with local models. For this tutorial though, we will leave it to the default OpenAI API. A guide for downloading Ollama along with local models is available [here](#installing-and-using-ollama-local-models).\n3. Visual Studio Code or any other code editor is not mandatory, but it makes it easier to navigate and edit files.\n4. Git/GitHub is not mandatory, you can download the framework files through your browser. We will not be showing how to use Git in this tutorial.\n5. Docker is not mandatory for the full binaries installation, since the framework will run on your machine connecting to the Docker container through the Web UI RFC functionality.\n6. Running Agent Zero without Docker makes the process more complicated and it's thought for developers and contributors.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> Linux instructions are provided as general instructions for any Linux distribution. If you're using a distribution other than Debian/Ubuntu, you may need to adjust the instructions accordingly.\n>\n> For Debian/Ubuntu, just follow the macOS instructions, as they are the same.\n\n## 1. Install Conda (miniconda)\n- Conda is a Python environment manager, it will help you keep your projects and installations separated. \n- It's a lightweight version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others.\n\n1. Go to the download page of miniconda [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#miniconda-latest-installer-links). If the link does not work, just search the web for \"miniconda download\".\n2. Based on your operating system, download the right installer of miniconda. For macOS select the version with \"pkg\" at the end.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-1.png\" alt=\"miniconda download win\" width=\"500\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-5.png\" alt=\"miniconda download macos\" width=\"500\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n3. Run the installer and go through the installation process, here you can leave everything to default and just click Next, Next... The same goes for macOS with the \"pkg\" graphical installer.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image.png\" alt=\"miniconda install\" width=\"200\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-2.png\" alt=\"miniconda install\" width=\"200\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-3.png\" alt=\"miniconda install\" width=\"200\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-4.png\" alt=\"miniconda install\" width=\"200\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n4. After the installation is complete, you should have \"Anaconda Powershell Prompt\" installed on your Windows machine. On macOS, when you open the Terminal application in your Applications folder and type \"conda --version\", you should see the version installed.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-6.png\" alt=\"miniconda installed\" height=\"100\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-7.png\" alt=\"miniconda installed\" height=\"100\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n\n## 2. Download Agent Zero\n- You can clone the Agent Zero repository (https://github.com/frdel/agent-zero) from GitHub if you know how to use Git. In this tutorial I will just show how to download the files.\n\n1. Go to the Agent Zero releases [here](https://github.com/frdel/agent-zero/releases).\n2. The latest release is on the top of the list, click the \"Source Code (zip)\" button under \"Assets\" to download it.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-14-u.png\" alt=\"agent zero download\" width=\"500\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n3. Extract the downloaded archive where you want to have it. I will extract them to \"agent-zero\" folder on my Desktop - \"C:\\Users\\frdel\\Desktop\\agent-zero\" on Windows and \"/Users/frdel/Desktop/agent-zero\" on macOS.\n\n## 3. Set up Conda environment\n- Now that we have the project files and Conda, we can create **virtual Python environment** for this project, activate it and install requirements.\n\n1. Open your **\"Anaconda Powershell Prompt\"** application on windows or **\"Terminal\"** application on macOS.\n2. In the terminal, navigate to your Agent Zero folder using **\"cd\"** command. Replace the path with your actual Agent Zero folder path.\n~~~\ncd C:\\Users\\frdel\\Desktop\\agent-zero\n~~~\nYou should see your folder has changed on the next terminal line.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-15.png\" alt=\"agent zero cd\" height=\"100\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-16.png\" alt=\"agent zero cd\" height=\"100\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n3. Create Conda environment using command **\"conda create\"**. After **\"-n\"** is your environment name, you can choose your own, i will use **\"a0\"** - short for Agent Zero. After **\"python\"** is the Python version that Conda will install for you into this environment, right now, 3.12 works fine. **-y** skips confirmations.\n~~~\nconda create -n a0 python=3.12 -y\n~~~\n\n4. Once done, activate the new environment for this terminal window by another command:\n~~~\nconda activate a0\n~~~\nAnd you should see that the **(base)** on the left has changed to **(a0)**. This means that this terminal now uses the new **a0** virtual environment and all packages will be installed into this environment.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-17.png\" alt=\"conda env\" height=\"200\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-18.png\" alt=\"conda env\" height=\"200\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> If you open a new terminal window, you will need to activate the environment with \n> \"conda activate a0\" again for that window.\n\n5. Install requirements using **\"pip\"**. Pip is a Python package manager. We can install all required packages from requirements.txt file using command:\n~~~\npip install -r requirements.txt\n~~~\nThis might take some time. If you get any errors regarding version conflicts and compatibility, double check that your environment is activated and that you created that environment with the correct Python version.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-19.png\" alt=\"conda reqs\" height=\"200\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n## 4. Install Docker (Docker Desktop application)\nSimply put, Docker is a way of running virtual computers on your machine. These are lightweight, disposable and isolated from your operating system, so it is a way to sandbox Agent Zero.\n- Agent Zero only connects to the Docker container when it needs to execute code and commands. The frameworks itself runs on your machine.\n- Docker has a desktop application with GUI for all major operating system, which is the recommended way to install it.\n\n1. Go to the download page of Docker Desktop [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). If the link does not work, just search the web for \"docker desktop download\".\n2. Download the version for your operating system. Don't be tricked by the seemingly missing windows intel/amd version, it's the button itself, not in the dropdown menu.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-8.png\" alt=\"docker download\" width=\"200\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n3. Run the installer and go through the installation process. It should be even shorter than Conda installation, you can leave everything to default. On macOS, the installer is a \"dmg\" image, so just drag and drop the application to your Applications folder like always.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-9.png\" alt=\"docker install\" width=\"300\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-10.png\" alt=\"docker install\" width=\"300\"/>\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-12.png\" alt=\"docker install\" width=\"300\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n\n4. Once installed, you should see Docker Desktop application on your Windows/Mac machine. \n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-11.png\" alt=\"docker installed\" height=\"100\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-13.png\" alt=\"docker installed\" height=\"100\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n5. Create account in the application.\n- It's required to be signed in to the Docker Hub, so create a free account in the Docker Desktop application, you will be prompted when the application first runs.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> **Important macOS-only Docker Configuration:** In Docker Desktop's preferences \n> (Docker menu) go to Settings, navigate to \"Advanced\" and check \"Allow the default \n> Docker socket to be used (requires password).\"  This allows Agent Zero to \n> communicate with the Docker daemon.\n\n![docker socket macOS](res/setup/macsocket.png)\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> **Linux Users:** You can install both Docker Desktop or docker-ce (Community Edition). \n> For Docker Desktop, follow the instructions for your specific Linux distribution [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/). \n> For docker-ce, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).\n>\n> If you're using docker-ce, you will need to add your user to the `docker` group to be able to run docker commands without sudo. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`. Then log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.\n>\n> Login in the Docker CLI with `docker login` and provide your Docker Hub credentials.\n\n6. Pull the Docker image\n- Agent Zero needs a Docker image to be pulled from the Docker Hub to be run, even when using the full binaries.\nYou can refer to the [installation instructions above](#windows-macos-and-linux-setup-guide) to run the Docker container and then resume from the next step. There are two differences:\n  - You need to map two ports instead of one:\n    - 55022 in the first field to run the Remote Function Call SSH\n    - 0 in the second field to run the Web UI in automatic port assignment\n  - You need to map the `/a0` volume to the location of your local Agent Zero folder.\n- Run the Docker container following the instructions.\n\n## 5. Run the local Agent Zero instance\nRun the Agent Zero with Web UI:\n~~~\npython run_ui.py\n~~~\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-21.png\" alt=\"run ui\" height=\"110\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n- Open the URL shown in terminal in your web browser. You should see the Agent Zero interface.\n\n## 6. Configure Agent Zero\nNow we can configure Agent Zero - select models, settings, API Keys etc. Refer to the [Usage](usage.md#agent-configuration) guide for a full guide on how to configure Agent Zero.\n\n## 7. Configure Agent Zero RFC\nAgent Zero needs to be configured further to redirect some functions to the Docker container. This is crucial for development as A0 needs to run in a standardized environment to support all features.\n1. Go in \"Settings\" page in the Web UI of your local instance and go in the \"Development\" section.\n2. Set \"RFC Destination URL\" to `http://localhost`\n3. Set the two ports (HTTP and SSH) to the ones used when creating the Docker container\n4. Click \"Save\"\n\n![rfc local settings](res/setup/9-rfc-devpage-on-local-sbs-1.png)\n\n5. Go in \"Settings\" page in the Web UI of your Docker instance and go in the \"Development\" section.\n\n![rfc docker settings](res/setup/9-rfc-devpage-on-docker-instance-1.png)\n\n6. This time the page has only the password field, set it to the same password you used when creating the Docker container.\n7. Click \"Save\"\n8. Use the Development environment\n9. Now you have the full development environment to work on Agent Zero.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-22-1.png\" alt=\"run ui\" width=\"400\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-23-1.png\" alt=\"run ui\" width=\"400\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n      \n### Conclusion\nAfter following the instructions for your specific operating system, you should have Agent Zero successfully installed and running. You can now start exploring the framework's capabilities and experimenting with creating your own intelligent agents. \n\nIf you encounter any issues during the installation process, please consult the [Troubleshooting section](troubleshooting.md) of this documentation or refer to the Agent Zero [Skool](https://www.skool.com/agent-zero) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/Z2tun2N3) community for assistance.\n\n"

We'll cover launching the web UI, starting a new chat, and running a simple task.\n\n## Launching the Web UI\n1. Make sure you have Agent Zero installed and your environment set up correctly (refer to the [Installation guide](installation.md) if needed).\n2. Open a terminal in the Agent Zero directory and activate your conda environment (if you're using one).\n3. Run the following command:\n\n```bash\npython run_ui.py\n```\n\n4.  A message similar to this will appear in your terminal, indicating the Web UI is running:\n\n![](res/flask_link.png)\n\n5. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://127.0.0.1:50001`). You should see the Agent Zero Web UI.\n\n![New Chat](res/ui_newchat1.png)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> As you can see, the Web UI has four distinct buttons for easy chat management: \n> `New Chat`, `Reset Chat`, `Save Chat`, and `Load Chat`.\n> Chats can be saved and loaded individually in `json` format and are stored in the\n> `/tmp/chats` directory.\n\n    ![Chat Management](res/ui_chat_management.png)\n\n## Running a Simple Task\nLet's ask Agent Zero to download a YouTube video. Here's how:\n\n1.  Type \"Download a YouTube video for me\" in the chat input field and press Enter or click the send button.\n\n2. Agent Zero will process your request.  You'll see its \"thoughts\" and the actions it takes displayed in the UI. It will find a default already existing solution, that implies using the `code_execution_tool` to run a simple Python script to perform the task.\n\n3. The agent will then ask you for the URL of the YouTube video you want to download.\n\n## Example Interaction\nHere's an example of what you might see in the Web UI at step 3:\n![1](res/image-24.png)\n\n## Next Steps\nNow that you've run a simple task, you can experiment with more complex requests. Try asking Agent Zero to:\n\n* Perform calculations\n* Search the web for information\n* Execute shell commands\n* Explore web development tasks\n* Create or modify files\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The [Usage Guide](usage.md) provides more in-depth information on using Agent \n> Zero's various features, including prompt engineering, tool usage, and multi-agent \n> cooperation."

How do I ask Agent Zero to work directly on my files or dirs?**\n-   Place the files/dirs in the `work_dir` directory. Agent Zero will be able to perform tasks on them. The `work_dir` directory is located in the root directory of the Docker Container.\n\n**2. When I input something in the chat, nothing happens. What's wrong?**\n-   Check if you have set up API keys in the Settings page. If not, the application will not be able to communicate with the endpoints it needs to run LLMs and to perform tasks.\n\n**3. How do I integrate open-source models with Agent Zero?**\nRefer to the [Choosing your LLMs](installation.md#installing-and-using-ollama-local-models) section of the documentation for detailed instructions and examples for configuring different LLMs. Local models can be run using Ollama or LM Studio.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Some LLM providers offer free usage of their APIs, for example Groq, Mistral or SambaNova.\n\n**6. How can I make Agent Zero retain memory between sessions?**\nRefer to the [How to update Agent Zero](installation.md#how-to-update-agent-zero) section of the documentation for instructions on how to update Agent Zero while retaining memory and data.\n\n**7. Where can I find more documentation or tutorials?**\n-   Join the Agent Zero [Skool](https://www.skool.com/agent-zero) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/Z2tun2N3) community for support and discussions.\n\n**8. How do I adjust API rate limits?**\nModify the `rate_limit_seconds` and `rate_limit_requests` parameters in the `AgentConfig` class within `initialize.py`.\n\n**9. My code_execution_tool doesn't work, what's wrong?**\n-   Ensure you have Docker installed and running.  If using Docker Desktop on macOS, grant it access to your project files in Docker Desktop's settings.  Check the [Installation guide](installation.md#4-install-docker-docker-desktop-application) for more details.\n-   Verify that the Docker image is updated.\n\n**10. Can Agent Zero interact with external APIs or services (e.g., WhatsApp)?**\nExtending Agent Zero to interact with external APIs is possible by creating custom tools or solutions. Refer to the documentation on creating them. \n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Installation**\n- **Docker Issues:** If Docker containers fail to start, consult the Docker documentation and verify your Docker installation and configuration.  On macOS, ensure you've granted Docker access to your project files in Docker Desktop's settings as described in the [Installation guide](installation.md#4-install-docker-docker-desktop-application).

        "content": "# Agent Zero Tunnel Feature\n\nThe tunnel feature in Agent Zero allows you to expose your local Agent Zero instance to the internet using Flaredantic tunnels. This makes it possible to share your Agent Zero instance with others without requiring them to install and run Agent Zero themselves.\n\n## How It Works\n\nAgent Zero uses the [Flaredantic](https://pypi.org/project/flaredantic/) library to create secure tunnels to expose your local instance to the internet. These tunnels:\n\n- Are secure (HTTPS)\n- Don't require any configuration\n- Generate unique URLs for each session\n- Can be regenerated on demand\n\n## Using the Tunnel Feature\n\n1. Open the settings and navigate to the \"External Services\" tab\n2. Click on \"Flare Tunnel\" in the navigation menu\n3. Click the \"Create Tunnel\" button to generate a new tunnel\n4. Once created, the tunnel URL will be displayed and can be copied to share with others\n5. The tunnel URL will remain active until you stop the tunnel or close the Agent Zero application\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nWhen sharing your Agent Zero instance via a tunnel:\n\n- Anyone with the URL can access your Agent Zero instance\n- No additional authentication is added beyond what your Agent Zero instance already has\n- Consider setting up authentication if you're sharing sensitive information\n- The tunnel exposes your local Agent Zero instance, not your entire system\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues with the tunnel feature:\n\n1. Check your internet connection\n2. Try refreshing the tunnel URL\n3. Restart Agent Zero\n4. Check the console logs for any error messages\n\n## Adding Authentication\n\nTo add basic authentication to your Agent Zero instance when using tunnels, you can set the following environment variables:\n\n```\nAUTH_LOGIN=your_username\nAUTH_PASSWORD=your_password\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the username and password directly in the settings:\n\n1. Open the settings modal in the Agent Zero UI\n2. Navigate to the \"External Services\" tab\n3. Find the \"Authentication\" section\n4. Enter your desired username and password in the \"UI Login\" and \"UI Password\" fields\n5. Click the \"Save\" button to apply the changes\n\nThis will require users to enter these credentials when accessing your tunneled Agent Zero instance. When attempting to create a tunnel without authentication configured, Agent Zero will display a security warning."

The agent will handle them as a batch while keeping you informed of the progress.\n\n## Tool Usage\nAgent Zero's power comes from its ability to use [tools](architecture.md#tools). Here's how to leverage them effectively:\n\n- **Understand Tools:** Agent Zero includes default tools like knowledge (powered by SearXNG), webpage content, code execution, and communication. Understand the capabilities of these tools and how to invoke them.\n\n## Example of Tools Usage: Web Search and Code Execution\nLet's say you want Agent Zero to perform some financial analysis tasks. Here's a possible prompt:\n\n> Please be a professional financial analyst. Find last month Bitcoin/ USD price trend and make a chart in your environment. The chart must  have highlighted key points corresponding with dates of major news  about cryptocurrency. Use the 'knowledge_tool' to find the price and  the news, and the 'code_execution_tool' to perform the rest of the job.\n\nAgent Zero might then:\n\n1. Use the `knowledge_tool` to query a reliable source for the Bitcoin price and for the news about cryptocurrency as prompted.\n2. Extract the price from the search results and save the news, extracting their dates and possible impact on the price.\n3. Use the `code_execution_tool` to execute a Python script that performs the graph creation and key points highlighting, using the extracted data and the news dates as inputs.\n4. Return the final chart that you'll find in `/work_dir`, responding to the user with the `response_tool`.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The first run of `code_execution_tool` may take a while as it downloads and builds the Agent Zero Docker image. Subsequent runs will be faster.\n\nThis example demonstrates how to combine multiple tools to achieve an analysis task. By mastering prompt engineering and tool usage, you can unlock the full potential of Agent Zero to solve complex problems.\n\n## Multi-Agent Cooperation\nOne of Agent Zero's unique features is multi-agent cooperation.\n\n* **Creating Sub-Agents:** Agents can create sub-agents to delegate sub-tasks.  This helps manage complexity and distribute workload.\n* **Communication:** Agents can communicate with each other, sharing information and coordinating actions. The system prompt and message history play a key role in guiding this communication.\n* **Hierarchy:** Agent Zero uses a [hierarchical structure](architecture.md#agent-hierarchy-and-communication), with superior agents delegating tasks to subordinates.  This allows for structured problem-solving and efficient resource allocation.\n\n![](res/physics.png)\n![](res/physics-2.png)\n\n## Prompt Engineering\nEffective prompt engineering is crucial for getting the most out of Agent Zero. Here are some tips and techniques:\n\n* **Be Clear and Specific:** Clearly state your desired outcome.  The more specific you are, the better Agent Zero can understand and fulfill your request.  Avoid vague or ambiguous language.\n* **Provide Context:** If necessary, provide background information or context to help the agent understand the task better. This might include relevant details, constraints, or desired format for the response.\n* **Break Down Complex Tasks:**  For complex tasks, break them down into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.  This makes it easier for the agent to reason through the problem and generate a solution.\n* **Iterative Refinement:** Don't expect perfect results on the first try.  Experiment with different prompts, refine your instructions based on the agent's responses, and iterate until you achieve the desired outcome. To achieve a full-stack, web-app development task, for example, you might need to iterate for a few hours for 100% success.\n\n## Voice Interface\nAgent Zero provides both Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) capabilities for natural voice interaction:\n\n### Text-to-Speech\nEnable voice responses from agents:\n* Toggle the \"Speech\" switch in the Preferences section of the sidebar\n* Agents will use your system's built-in voice synthesizer to speak their messages\n* Click the \"Stop Speech\" button above the input area to immediately stop any ongoing speech\n\n![TTS Stop Speech](res/ui-tts-stop-speech.png)\n\n- The interface allows users to stop speech at any time if a response is too lengthy or if they wish to intervene during the conversation.\n\nThe TTS uses a standard voice interface provided by modern browsers, which may sound robotic but is effective and does not require complex AI models. This ensures low latency and quick responses across various platforms, including mobile devices.\n\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The Text-to-Speech feature is great for:\n> - Multitasking while receiving agent responses\n> - Accessibility purposes\n> - Creating a more interactive experience\n\n### Speech-to-Text\nSend voice messages to agents using OpenAI's Whisper model (does not require OpenAI API key!):\n\n1. Click the microphone button in the input area to start recording\n2. The button color indicates the current status:\n   - Grey: Inactive\n   - Red: Listening\n   - Green: Recording\n   - Teal: Waiting\n   - Cyan (pulsing): Processing\n\nUsers can adjust settings such as silence threshold and message duration before sending to optimize their interaction experience.\n\nConfigure STT settings in the Settings page:\n* **Model Size:** Choose between Base (74M, English) or other models\n  - Note: Only Large and Turbo models support multiple languages\n* **Language Code:** Set your preferred language (e.g., 'en', 'fr', 'it', 'cz')\n* **Silence Detection:**\n  - Threshold: Adjust sensitivity (lower values are more sensitive)\n  - Duration: Set how long silence should last before ending recording\n  - Timeout: Set maximum waiting time before closing the microphone\n\n![Speech to Text Settings](res/ui-settings-5-speech-to-text.png)\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> All STT and TTS functionalities operate locally within the Docker container, \n> ensuring that no data is transmitted to external servers or OpenAI APIs. This \n> enhances user privacy while maintaining functionality.\n\n### Mathematical Expressions\nAgent Zero supports KaTeX for beautiful mathematical typesetting:\n\n* **Inline Math:** Use single dollars `$...$` for inline expressions\n  - Example: Type `The area of a circle is $A = πr^2$`\n  - Renders as: The area of a circle is $A = πr^2$\n\n* **Display Math:** Use double dollars `$$...$$` for centered display equations\n  - Example: Type `$$F = G\\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$`\n  - Renders as a centered equation\n\n![KaTeX](res/ui-katex-1.png)\n\n* **Complex Mathematics:** Supports full KaTeX syntax for:\n  - Fractions, exponents, and roots\n  - Matrices and arrays\n  - Greek letters and mathematical symbols\n  - Integrals, summations, and limits\n  - Mathematical alignments and equations\n\n![KaTeX display](res/ui-katex-2.png)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> When asking the agent to solve mathematical problems, it will automatically respond using KaTeX formatting for clear and professional-looking mathematical expressions.\n\n### File Browser\nAgent Zero provides a powerful file browser interface for managing your workspace:\n\n#### Interface Overview\n- **Navigation Bar**: Shows current directory path with \"Up\" button for parent directory\n- **File List**: Displays files and directories with key information:\n  - Name (sortable)\n  - Size in bytes\n  - Last modified timestamp\n- **Action Icons**: Each file/directory has:\n  - Download button\n  - Delete button (with confirmation)\n\n![File Browser](res/ui-file-browser.png)\n\n#### Features\n- **Directory Navigation**: \n  - Click directories to enter them\n  - Use \"Up\" button to move to parent directory\n  - Current path always visible for context\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The files browser allows the user to go in the Agent Zero root folder if you click the `Up` button, but the working directory of Agents will always be `/work_dir`\n> \n- **File Operations**:\n  - Create new files and directories\n  - Delete existing files and directories\n  - Download files to your local system\n  - Upload files from your local system\n- **File Information**:\n  - Visual indicators for file types (folders, code files, documents)\n  - Size information in human-readable format\n  - Last modification timestamps\n- **Bulk Operations**:\n  - Upload multiple files simultaneously\n  - Select and manage multiple files at once\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The File Browser integrates seamlessly with Agent Zero's capabilities. You can reference files directly in your conversations, and the agent can help you manage, modify, and organize your files."

It is designed to be dynamic, organically growing, and learning as you use it.\n- Agent Zero is fully transparent, readable, comprehensible, customizable, and interactive.\n- Agent Zero uses the computer as a tool to accomplish its (your) tasks.\n\n# 💡 Key Features\n\n1. **General-purpose Assistant**\n\n- Agent Zero is not pre-programmed for specific tasks (but can be). It is meant to be a general-purpose personal assistant. Give it a task, and it will gather information, execute commands and code, cooperate with other agent instances, and do its best to accomplish it.\n- It has a persistent memory, allowing it to memorize previous solutions, code, facts, instructions, etc., to solve tasks faster and more reliably in the future.\n\n![Agent 0 Working](/docs/res/ui-screen-2.png)\n\n2. **Computer as a Tool**\n\n- Agent Zero uses the operating system as a tool to accomplish its tasks. It has no single-purpose tools pre-programmed. Instead, it can write its own code and use the terminal to create and use its own tools as needed.\n- The only default tools in its arsenal are online search, memory features, communication (with the user and other agents), and code/terminal execution. Everything else is created by the agent itself or can be extended by the user.\n- Tool usage functionality has been developed from scratch to be the most compatible and reliable, even with very small models.\n- **Default Tools:** Agent Zero includes tools like knowledge, webpage content, code execution, and communication.\n- **Creating Custom Tools:** Extend Agent Zero's functionality by creating your own custom tools.\n- **Instruments:** Instruments are a new type of tool that allow you to create custom functions and procedures that can be called by Agent Zero.\n\n3. **Multi-agent Cooperation**\n\n- Every agent has a superior agent giving it tasks and instructions. Every agent then reports back to its superior.\n- In the case of the first agent in the chain (Agent 0), the superior is the human user; the agent sees no difference.\n- Every agent can create its subordinate agent to help break down and solve subtasks. This helps all agents keep their context clean and focused.\n\n![Multi-agent](docs/res/physics.png)\n![Multi-agent 2](docs/res/physics-2.png)\n\n4. **Completely Customizable and Extensible**\n\n- Almost nothing in this framework is hard-coded. Nothing is hidden. Everything can be extended or changed by the user.\n- The whole behavior is defined by a system prompt in the **prompts/default/agent.system.md** file. Change this prompt and change the framework dramatically.\n- The framework does not guide or limit the agent in any way. There are no hard-coded rails that agents have to follow.\n- Every prompt, every small message template sent to the agent in its communication loop can be found in the **prompts/** folder and changed.\n- Every default tool can be found in the **python/tools/** folder and changed or copied to create new predefined tools.\n\n![Prompts](/docs/res/prompts.png)\n\n5. **Communication is Key**\n\n- Give your agent a proper system prompt and instructions, and it can do miracles.\n- Agents can communicate with their superiors and subordinates, asking questions, giving instructions, and providing guidance. Instruct your agents in the system prompt on how to communicate effectively.\n- The terminal interface is real-time streamed and interactive. You can stop and intervene at any point. If you see your agent heading in the wrong direction, just stop and tell it right away.\n- There is a lot of freedom in this framework. You can instruct your agents to regularly report back to superiors asking for permission to continue. You can instruct them to use point-scoring systems when deciding when to delegate subtasks. Superiors can double-check subordinates' results and dispute. The possibilities are endless.\n\n## 🚀 Things you can build with Agent Zero\n\n- **Development Projects** - `\"Create a React dashboard with real-time data visualization\"`\n\n- **Data Analysis** - `\"Analyze last quarter's NVIDIA sales data and create trend reports\"`\n\n- **Content Creation** - `\"Write a technical blog post about microservices\"`\n\n- **System Admin** - `\"Set up a monitoring system for our web servers\"`\n\n- **Research** - `\"Gather and summarize five recent AI papers about CoT prompting\"`\n\n# Hacking Edition\n- Agent Zero also offers a Hacking Edition based on Kali linux with modified prompts for cybersecurity tasks\n- The setup is the same as the regular version, just use the frdel/agent-zero-run:hacking image instead of frdel/agent-zero-run\n\n\n# ⚙️ Installation\n\nClick to open a video to learn how to install Agent Zero:\n\n[![Easy Installation guide](/docs/res/easy_ins_vid.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1_peV8szf8)\n\nA detailed setup guide for Windows, macOS, and Linux with a video can be found in the Agent Zero Documentation at [this page](./docs/installation.md).\n\n### ⚡ Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Pull and run with Docker\n\ndocker pull frdel/agent-zero-run\ndocker run -p 50001:80 frdel/agent-zero-run\n\n# Visit http://localhost:50001 to start\n```\n\n## 🐳 Fully Dockerized, with Speech-to-Text and TTS\n\n![Settings](docs/res/settings-page-ui.png)\n\n- Customizable settings allow users to tailor the agent's behavior and responses to their needs.\n- The Web UI output is very clean, fluid, colorful, readable, and interactive; nothing is hidden.\n- You can load or save chats directly within the Web UI.\n- The same output you see in the terminal is automatically saved to an HTML file in **logs/** folder for every session.\n\n![Time example](/docs/res/time_example.jpg)\n\n- Agent output is streamed in real-time, allowing users to read along and intervene at any time.\n- No coding is required; only prompting and communication skills are necessary.\n- With a solid system prompt, the framework is reliable even with small models, including precise tool usage.\n\n## 👀 Keep in Mind\n\n1. **Agent Zero Can Be Dangerous!**\n\n- With proper instruction, Agent Zero is capable of many things, even potentially dangerous actions concerning your computer, data, or accounts. Always run Agent Zero in an isolated environment (like Docker) and be careful what you wish for.\n\n2. **Agent Zero Is Prompt-based.**\n\n- The whole framework is guided by the **prompts/** folder. Agent guidelines, tool instructions, messages, utility AI functions, it's all there.\n\n\n## 📚 Read the Documentation\n\n| Page | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [Installation](./docs/installation.md) | Installation, setup and configuration |\n| [Usage](./docs/usage.md) | Basic and advanced usage |\n| [Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) | System design and components |\n| [Contributing](./docs/contribution.md) | How to contribute |\n| [Troubleshooting](./docs/troubleshooting.md) | Common issues and their solutions |\n\n## Coming soon\n\n- **MCP**\n- **Knowledge and RAG Tools**\n\n## 🎯 Changelog\n\n### v0.8.4.1\n- Various bugfixes related to context management\n- Message formatting improvements\n- Scheduler improvements\n- New model provider\n- Input tool fix\n- Compatibility and stability improvements\n\n### v0.8.4\n[Release video](https://youtu.be/QBh_h_D_E24)\n\n- **Remote access (mobile)**\n\n### v0.8.3.1\n[Release video](https://youtu.be/AGNpQ3_GxFQ)\n\n- **Automatic embedding**\n\n\n### v0.8.3\n[Release video](https://youtu.be/bPIZo0poalY)\n\n- ***Planning and scheduling***\n\n### v0.8.2\n[Release video](https://youtu.be/xMUNynQ9x6Y)\n\n- **Multitasking in terminal**\n- **Chat names**\n\n### v0.8.1\n[Release video](https://youtu.be/quv145buW74)\n\n- **Browser Agent**\n- **UX Improvements**\n\n### v0.8\n[Release video](https://youtu.be/cHDCCSr1YRI)\n\n- **Docker Runtime**\n- **New Messages History and Summarization System**\n- **Agent Behavior Change and Management**\n- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT)**\n- **Settings Page in Web UI**\n- **SearXNG Integration Replacing Perplexity + DuckDuckGo**\n- **File Browser Functionality**\n- **KaTeX Math Visualization Support**\n- **In-chat File Attachments**\n\n### v0.7\n[Release video](https://youtu.be/U_Gl0NPalKA)\n\n- **Automatic Memory**\n- **UI Improvements**\n- **Instruments**\n- **Extensions Framework**\n- **Reflection Prompts**\n- **Bug Fixes**\n\n## 🤝 Community and Support\n\n- [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/B8KZKNsPpj) for live discussions or [visit our Skool Community](https://www.skool.com/agent-zero).\n- [Follow our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AgentZeroFW) for hands-on explanations and tutorials\n- [Report Issues](https://github.com/frdel/agent-zero/issues) for bug fixes and features\n"

        "content": "# Architecture Overview\nAgent Zero is built on a flexible and modular architecture designed for extensibility and customization. This section outlines the key components and the interactions between them.\n\n## System Architecture\nThis simplified diagram illustrates the hierarchical relationship between agents and their interaction with tools, extensions, instruments, prompts, memory and knowledge base.\n\n![Agent Zero Architecture](res/arch-01.svg)\n\nThe user or Agent 0 is at the top of the hierarchy, delegating tasks to subordinate agents, which can further delegate to other agents. Each agent can utilize tools and access the shared assets (prompts, memory, knowledge, extensions and instruments) to perform its tasks.\n\n## Runtime Architecture\nAgent Zero's runtime architecture is built around Docker containers:\n\n1. **Host System (your machine)**:\n   - Requires only Docker and a web browser\n   - Runs Docker Desktop or Docker Engine\n   - Handles container orchestration\n\n2. **Runtime Container**:\n   - Houses the complete Agent Zero framework\n   - Manages the Web UI and API endpoints\n   - Handles all core functionalities including code execution\n   - Provides a standardized environment across all platforms\n\nThis architecture ensures:\n- Consistent environment across platforms\n- Simplified deployment and updates\n- Enhanced security through containerization\n- Reduced dependency requirements on host systems\n- Flexible deployment options for advanced users\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The legacy approach of running Agent Zero directly on the host system (using Python, Conda, etc.) \n> is still possible but requires Remote Function Calling (RFC) configuration through the Settings \n> page. See [Full Binaries Installation](installation.md#in-depth-guide-for-full-binaries-installation) \n> for detailed instructions.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Directory Structure\n| Directory | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `/docker` | Docker-related files for runtime container |\n| `/docs` | Documentation files and guides |\n| `/instruments` | Custom scripts and tools for runtime environment |\n| `/knowledge` | Knowledge base storage |\n| `/logs` | HTML CLI-style chat logs |\n| `/memory` | Persistent agent memory storage |\n| `/prompts` | System and tool prompts |\n| `/python` | Core Python codebase: |\n| `/api` | API endpoints and interfaces |\n| `/extensions` | Modular extensions |\n| `/helpers` | Utility functions |\n| `/tools` | Tool implementations |\n| `/tmp` | Temporary runtime data |\n| `/webui` | Web interface components: |\n| `/css` | Stylesheets |\n| `/js` | JavaScript modules |\n| `/public` | Static assets |\n| `/work_dir` | Working directory |\n\n### Key Files\n| File | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `.env` | Environment configuration |\n| `agent.py` | Core agent implementation |\n| `example.env` | Configuration template |\n| `initialize.py` | Framework initialization |\n| `models.py` | Model providers and configs |\n| `preload.py` | Pre-initialization routines |\n| `prepare.py` | Environment preparation |\n| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |\n| `run_cli.py` | CLI launcher |\n| `run_ui.py` | Web UI launcher |\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> When using the Docker runtime container, these directories are mounted \n> within the `/a0` volume for data persistence until the container is restarted or deleted.\n\n## Core Components\nAgent Zero's architecture revolves around the following key components:\n\n### 1. Agents\nThe core actors within the framework. Agents receive instructions, reason, make decisions, and utilize tools to achieve their objectives. Agents operate within a hierarchical structure, with superior agents delegating tasks to subordinate agents.\n\n#### Agent Hierarchy and Communication\nAgent Zero employs a hierarchical agent structure, where a top-level agent (often the user) can delegate tasks to subordinate agents. This hierarchy allows for the efficient breakdown of complex tasks into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.\n\nCommunication flows between agents through messages, which are structured according to the prompt templates. These messages typically include:\n\n| Argument | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Thoughts:` | The agent's Chain of Thought and planning process |\n| `Tool name:` | The specific tool used by the agent |\n| `Responses or queries:` | Results, feedback or queries from tools or other agents |\n\n#### Interaction Flow\nA typical interaction flow within Agent Zero might look like this:\n\n![Interaction Flow](res/flow-01.svg)\n\n1. The user provides an instruction to Agent 0\n2. Agent 0 initializes VectorDB and access memory\n3. Agent 0 analyzes the instruction and formulates a plan using `thoughts` argument, possibly involving the use of tools or the creation of sub-agents\n4. If necessary, Agent 0 delegates sub-tasks to subordinate agents\n5. Agents use tools to perform actions, both providing arguments and responses or queries\n6. Agents communicate results and feedback back up the hierarchy\n7. Agent 0 provides the final response to the user\n\n### 2. Tools\nTools are functionalities that agents can leverage. These can include anything from web search and code execution to interacting with APIs or controlling external software. Agent Zero provides a mechanism for defining and integrating both built-in and custom tools.\n\n#### Built-in Tools\nAgent Zero comes with a set of built-in tools designed to help agents perform tasks efficiently:\n\n| Tool | Function |\n| --- | --- |\n| behavior_adjustment | Agent Zero use this tool to change its behavior according to a prior request from the user.\n| call_subordinate | Allows agents to delegate tasks to subordinate agents |\n| code_execution_tool | Allows agents to execute Python, Node.js, and Shell code in the terminal |\n| input | Allows agents to use the keyboard to interact with an active shell |\n| knowledge_tool | Enables agents to retrieve information from memory, knowledge base or online external sources |\n| response_tool | Allows agents to output a response |\n| memory_tool | Enables agents to save, load, delete and forget information from memory |\n| webpage_content_tool | Enables agents to fetch and analyze the text content of webpages |\n\n#### Knowledge Tool\nThe `knowledge_tool` uses SearXNG to search the web and retrieve information. It can also search the local knowledge base and memory for relevant information. The tool returns a summary of the information, which can be used by the agent to make decisions or answer questions.\n\n#### SearXNG Integration\nAgent Zero has integrated SearXNG as its primary search tool, replacing the previous knowledge tools (Perplexity and DuckDuckGo). This integration enhances the agent's ability to retrieve information while ensuring user privacy and customization.\n\n- Privacy-Focused Search\nSearXNG is an open-source metasearch engine that allows users to search multiple sources without tracking their queries. This integration ensures that user data remains private and secure while accessing a wide range of information.\n\n- Enhanced Search Capabilities\nThe integration provides access to various types of content, including images, videos, and news articles, allowing users to gather comprehensive information on any topic.\n\n- Fallback Mechanism\nIn cases where SearXNG might not return satisfactory results, Agent Zero can be configured to fall back on other sources or methods, ensuring that users always have access to information.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The Knowledge Tool is designed to work seamlessly with both online searches through \n> SearXNG and local knowledge base queries, providing a comprehensive information \n> retrieval system.\n\n#### Custom Tools\nUsers can create custom tools to extend Agent Zero's capabilities. Custom tools can be integrated into the framework by defining a tool specification, which includes the tool's prompt to be placed in `/prompts/$FOLDERNAME/agent.system.tool.$TOOLNAME.md`, as detailed below.\n\n1. Create `agent.system.tool.$TOOL_NAME.md` in `prompts/$SUBDIR`\n2. Add reference in `agent.system.tools.md`\n3. If needed, implement tool class in `python/tools` using `Tool` base class\n4. Follow existing patterns for consistency\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Tools are always present in system prompt, so you should keep them to minimum. \n> To save yourself some tokens, use the [Instruments module](#adding-instruments) \n> to call custom scripts or functions.\n\n### 3. Memory System\nThe memory system is a critical component of Agent Zero, enabling the agent to learn and adapt from past interactions. It operates on a hybrid model where part of the memory is managed automatically by the framework while users can also manually input and extract information.\n\n#### Memory Structure\nThe memory is categorized into four distinct areas:\n- **Storage and retrieval** of user-provided information (e.g., names, API keys)\n- **Fragments**: Contains pieces of information from previous conversations, updated automatically\n- **Solutions**: Stores successful solutions from past interactions for future reference\n- **Metadata**: Each memory entry includes metadata (IDs, timestamps), enabling efficient filtering and searching based on specific criteria\n\n#### Messages History and Summarization\n\nAgent Zero employs a sophisticated message history and summarization system to maintain context effectively while optimizing memory usage. This system dynamically manages the information flow, ensuring relevant details are readily available while efficiently handling the constraints of context windows.\n\n- **Context Extraction:** The system identifies key information from previous messages that are vital for ongoing discussions. This process mirrors how humans recall important memories, allowing less critical details to fade.\n- **Summarization Process:** Using natural language processing through the utility model, Agent Zero condenses the extracted information into concise summaries. By summarizing past interactions, Agent Zero can quickly recall important facts about the whole chat, leading to more appropriate responses.\n- **Contextual Relevance:** The summarized context is prioritized based on its relevance to the current topic, ensuring users receive the most pertinent information.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n- **Message Summaries**: Individual messages are summarized using a structured format that captures key information while reducing token usage.\n- **Dynamic Compression**: The system employs an intelligent compression strategy:\n  - Recent messages remain in their original form for immediate context.\n  - Older messages are gradually compressed into more concise summaries.\n  - Multiple compression levels allow for efficient context window usage.\n  - Original messages are preserved separately from summaries.\n- **Context Window Optimization**:\n  - Acts as a near-infinite short-term memory for single conversations.\n  - Dynamically adjusts compression ratios based on available space and settings.\n- **Bulk and Topic Summarization**:\n  - Groups related messages into thematic chunks for better organization.\n  - Generates concise summaries of multiple messages while preserving key context.\n  - Enables efficient navigation of long conversation histories.\n  - Maintains semantic connections between related topics.\n\nBy dynamically adjusting context windows and summarizing past interactions, Agent Zero enhances both efficiency and user experience. This innovation not only reflects the framework's commitment to being dynamic and user-centric, but also draws inspiration from human cognitive processes, making AI interactions more relatable and effective. Just as humans forget trivial details, Agent Zero intelligently condenses information to enhance communication.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> To maximize the effectiveness of context summarization, users should provide clear and specific instructions during interactions. This helps Agent Zero understand which details are most important to retain.\n\n### 4. Prompts\nThe `prompts` directory contains various Markdown files that control agent behavior and communication. The most important file is `agent.system.main.md`, which acts as a central hub, referencing other prompt files.\n\n#### Core Prompt Files\n| Prompt File | Description |\n|---|---|\n| agent.system.main.role.md | Defines the agent's overall role and capabilities |\n| agent.system.main.communication.md | Specifies how the agent should communicate |\n| agent.system.main.solving.md | Describes the agent's approach to tasks |\n| agent.system.main.tips.md | Provides additional tips or guidance |\n| agent.system.main.behaviour.md | Controls dynamic behavior adjustments and rules |\n| agent.system.main.environment.md | Defines the runtime environment context |\n| agent.system.tools.md | Organizes and calls the individual tool prompt files |\n| agent.system.tool.*.md | Individual tool prompt files |\n\n#### Prompt Organization\n- **Default Prompts**: Located in `prompts/default/`, serve as the base configuration\n- **Custom Prompts**: Can be placed in custom subdirectories (e.g., `prompts/my-custom/`)\n- **Behavior Files**: Stored in memory as `behaviour.md`, containing dynamic rules\n- **Tool Prompts**: Organized in tool-specific files for modularity\n\n#### Custom Prompts\n1. Create directory in `prompts/` (e.g., `my-custom-prompts`)\n2. Copy and modify needed files from `prompts/default/`\n3. Agent Zero will merge your custom files with the default ones\n4. Select your custom prompts in the Settings page (Agent Config section)\n\n#### Dynamic Behavior System\n- **Behavior Adjustment**: \n  - Agents can modify their behavior in real-time based on user instructions\n  - Behavior changes are automatically integrated into the system prompt\n  - Behavioral rules are merged intelligently, avoiding duplicates and conflicts\n\n- **Behavior Management Components**:\n  - `behaviour_adjustment.py`: Core tool for updating agent behavior\n  - `_20_behaviour_prompt.py`: Extension that injects behavior rules into system prompt\n  - Custom rules stored in the agent's memory directory as `behaviour.md`\n\n- **Behavior Update Process**:\n  1. User requests behavior changes (e.g., \"respond in UK English\")\n  2. System identifies behavioral instructions in conversation\n  3. New rules are merged with existing ruleset\n  4. Updated behavior is immediately applied\n\n![Behavior Adjustment](res/ui-behavior-change-chat.png)\n\n- **Integration with System Prompt**:\n  - Behavior rules are injected at the start of the system prompt\n  - Rules are formatted in a structured markdown format\n  - Changes are applied without disrupting other components\n  - Maintains separation between core functionality and behavioral rules\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> You can customize any of these files. Agent Zero will use the files in your custom `prompts_subdir` \n> if they exist, otherwise, it will fall back to the files in `prompts/default`.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The behavior system allows for dynamic adjustments without modifying the base prompt files.\n> Changes made through behavior rules persist across sessions while maintaining the core functionality.\n\n### 5. Knowledge\nKnowledge refers to the user-provided information and data that agents can leverage:\n\n- **Custom Knowledge**: Add files to `/knowledge/custom/main` directory manually or through the \"Import Knowledge\" button in the UI\n  - Supported formats: `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.csv`, `.html`, `.json`, `.md`\n  - Automatically imported and indexed\n  - Expandable format support\n\n- **Knowledge Base**: \n  - Can include PDFs, databases, books, documentation\n  - `/docs` folder automatically added\n  - Used for answering questions and decision-making\n  - Supports RAG-augmented tasks\n\n### 6. Instruments\nInstruments provide a way to add custom functionalities to Agent Zero without adding to the token count of the system prompt:\n- Stored in long-term memory of Agent Zero\n- Unlimited number of instruments available\n- Recalled when needed by the agent\n- Can modify agent behavior by introducing new procedures\n- Function calls or scripts to integrate with other systems\n- Scripts are run inside the Docker Container\n\n#### Adding Instruments\n1. Create folder in `instruments/custom` (no spaces in name)\n2. Add `.md` description file for the interface\n3. Add `.sh` script (or other executable) for implementation\n4. The agent will automatically detect and use the instrument\n\n### 7. Extensions\nExtensions are a powerful feature of Agent Zero, designed to keep the main codebase clean and organized while allowing for greater flexibility and modularity.\n\n#### Structure\nExtensions can be found in `python/extensions` directory:\n- **Folder Organization**: Extensions are stored in designated subfolders corresponding to different aspects of the agent's message loop\n- **Execution Order**: Files are executed in alphabetical order for predictable behavior\n- **Naming Convention**: Files start with numbers to control execution order\n- **Modularity**: Each extension focuses on a specific functionality\n\n#### Types\n- **Message Loop Prompts**: Handle system messages and history construction\n- **Memory Management**: Handle recall and solution memorization\n- **System Integration**: Manage interaction with external systems\n\n#### Adding Extensions\n1. Create Python file in appropriate `python/extensions` subfolder\n2. Follow naming convention for execution order (start with number)\n3. Implement functionality following existing patterns\n4. Ensure compatibility with main system\n5. Test thoroughly before deployment\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> Consider contributing valuable custom components to the main repository.\n> See [Contributing](contribution.md) for more information."

For Windows users, the Intel/AMD version is the main download button.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-8.png\" alt=\"docker download\" width=\"200\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> **Linux Users:** You can install either Docker Desktop or docker-ce (Community Edition). \n> For Docker Desktop, follow the instructions for your specific Linux distribution [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/). \n> For docker-ce, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).\n>\n> If you're using docker-ce, you'll need to add your user to the `docker` group:\n> ```bash\n> sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n> ```\n> Log out and back in, then run:\n> ```bash\n> docker login\n> ```\n\n1.3. Run the installer with default settings. On macOS, drag and drop the application to your Applications folder.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-9.png\" alt=\"docker install\" width=\"300\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-10.png\" alt=\"docker install\" width=\"300\"/>\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-12.png\" alt=\"docker install\" width=\"300\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n1.4. Once installed, launch Docker Desktop: \n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-11.png\" alt=\"docker installed\" height=\"100\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-13.png\" alt=\"docker installed\" height=\"100\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> **macOS Configuration:** In Docker Desktop's preferences (Docker menu) → Settings → \n> Advanced, enable \"Allow the default Docker socket to be used (requires password).\"\n\n![docker socket macOS](res/setup/macsocket.png)\n\n2. **Run Agent Zero:**\n\n- Note: Agent Zero also offers a Hacking Edition based on Kali linux with modified prompts for cybersecurity tasks. The setup is the same as the regular version, just use the frdel/agent-zero-run:hacking image instead of frdel/agent-zero-run.\n\n2.1. Pull the Agent Zero Docker image:\n- Search for `frdel/agent-zero-run` in Docker Desktop\n- Click the `Pull` button\n- The image will be downloaded to your machine in a few minutes\n\n![docker pull](res/setup/1-docker-image-search.png)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Alternatively, run the following command in your terminal:\n>\n> ```bash\n> docker pull frdel/agent-zero-run\n> ```\n\n2.2. Create a data directory for persistence:\n- Choose or create a directory on your machine where you want to store Agent Zero's data\n- This can be any location you prefer (e.g., `C:/agent-zero-data` or `/home/user/agent-zero-data`)\n- This directory will contain all your Agent Zero files, like the legacy root folder structure:\n  - `/memory` - Agent's memory and learned information\n  - `/knowledge` - Knowledge base\n  - `/instruments` - Instruments and functions\n  - `/prompts` - Prompt files\n  - `/work_dir` - Working directory\n  - `.env` - Your API keys\n  - `settings.json` - Your Agent Zero settings\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Choose a location that's easy to access and backup. All your Agent Zero data \n> will be directly accessible in this directory.\n\n2.3. Run the container:\n- In Docker Desktop, go back to the \"Images\" tab\n- Click the `Run` button next to the `frdel/agent-zero-run` image\n- Open the \"Optional settings\" menu\n- Set the port to `0` in the second \"Host port\" field (for automatic port assignment)\n\nOptionally you can map local folders for file persistence:\n- Under \"Volumes\", configure:\n  - Host path: Your chosen directory (e.g., `C:\\agent-zero-data`)\n  - Container path: `/a0`\n\n![docker port mapping](res/setup/3-docker-port-mapping.png)\n\n- Click the `Run` button in the \"Images\" tab.\n- The container will start and show in the \"Containers\" tab\n\n![docker containers](res/setup/4-docker-container-started.png)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Alternatively, run the following command in your terminal:\n> ```bash\n> docker run -p $PORT:80 -v /path/to/your/data:/a0 frdel/agent-zero-run\n> ```\n> - Replace `$PORT` with the port you want to use (e.g., `50080`)\n> - Replace `/path/to/your/data` with your chosen directory path\n\n2.4. Access the Web UI:\n- The framework will take a few seconds to initialize and the Docker logs will look like the image below.\n- Find the mapped port in Docker Desktop (shown as `<PORT>:80`) or click the port right under the container ID as shown in the image below\n\n![docker logs](res/setup/5-docker-click-to-open.png)\n\n- Open `http://localhost:<PORT>` in your browser\n- The Web UI will open. Agent Zero is ready for configuration!\n\n![docker ui](res/setup/6-docker-a0-running.png)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> You can also access the Web UI by clicking the ports right under the container ID in Docker Desktop.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> After starting the container, you'll find all Agent Zero files in your chosen \n> directory. You can access and edit these files directly on your machine, and \n> the changes will be immediately reflected in the running container.\n\n3. Configure Agent Zero\n- Refer to the following sections for a full guide on how to configure Agent Zero.\n\n## Settings Configuration\nAgent Zero provides a comprehensive settings interface to customize various aspects of its functionality. Access the settings by clicking the \"Settings\"button with a gear icon in the sidebar.\n\n### Agent Configuration\n- **Prompts Subdirectory:** Choose the subdirectory within `/prompts` for agent behavior customization. The 'default' directory contains the standard prompts.\n- **Memory Subdirectory:** Select the subdirectory for agent memory storage, allowing separation between different instances.\n- **Knowledge Subdirectory:** Specify the location of custom knowledge files to enhance the agent's understanding.\n\n![settings](res/setup/settings/1-agentConfig.png)\n\n### Chat Model Settings\n- **Provider:** Select the chat model provider (e.g., Ollama)\n- **Model Name:** Choose the specific model (e.g., llama3.2)\n- **Temperature:** Adjust response randomness (0 for deterministic, higher values for more creative responses)\n- **Context Length:** Set the maximum token limit for context window\n- **Context Window Space:** Configure how much of the context window is dedicated to chat history\n\n![chat model settings](res/setup/settings/2-chat-model.png)\n\n### Utility Model Configuration\n- **Provider & Model:** Select a smaller, faster model for utility tasks like memory organization and summarization\n- **Temperature:** Adjust the determinism of utility responses\n\n### Embedding Model Settings\n- **Provider:** Choose the embedding model provider (e.g., OpenAI)\n- **Model Name:** Select the specific embedding model (e.g., text-embedding-3-small)\n\n### Speech to Text Options\n- **Model Size:** Choose the speech recognition model size\n- **Language Code:** Set the primary language for voice recognition\n- **Silence Settings:** Configure silence threshold, duration, and timeout parameters for voice input\n\n### API Keys\n- Configure API keys for various service providers directly within the Web UI\n- Click `Save` to confirm your settings\n\n### Authentication\n- **UI Login:** Set username for web interface access\n- **UI Password:** Configure password for web interface security\n- **Root Password:** Manage Docker container root password for SSH access\n\n![settings](res/setup/settings/3-auth.png)\n\n### Development Settings\n- **RFC Parameters (local instances only):** configure URLs and ports for remote function calls between instances\n- **RFC Password:** Configure password for remote function calls\nLearn more about Remote Function Calls and their purpose [here](#7-configure-agent-zero-rfc).\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Always keep your API keys and passwords secure.\n\n# Choosing Your LLMs\nThe Settings page is the control center for selecting the Large Language Models (LLMs) that power Agent Zero.  You can choose different LLMs for different roles:\n\n| LLM Role | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `chat_llm` | This is the primary LLM used for conversations and generating responses. |\n| `utility_llm` | This LLM handles internal tasks like summarizing messages, managing memory, and processing internal prompts.  Using a smaller, less expensive model here can improve efficiency. |\n| `embedding_llm` | This LLM is responsible for generating embeddings used for memory retrieval and knowledge base lookups. Changing the `embedding_llm` will re-index all of A0's memory. |\n\n**How to Change:**\n1. Open Settings page in the Web UI.\n2. Choose the provider for the LLM for each role (Chat model, Utility model, Embedding model) and write the model name.\n3. Click \"Save\" to apply the changes.\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Changing the `embedding_llm` will re-index all the memory and knowledge, and \n> requires clearing the `memory` folder to avoid errors, as the embeddings can't be \n> mixed in the vector database. Note that this will DELETE ALL of Agent Zero's memory.\n\n## Installing and Using Ollama (Local Models)\nIf you're interested in Ollama, which is a powerful tool that allows you to run various large language models locally, here's how to install and use it:\n\n#### First step: installation\n**On Windows:**\n\nDownload Ollama from the official website and install it on your machine.\n\n<button>[Download Ollama Setup](https://ollama.com/download/OllamaSetup.exe)</button>\n\n**On macOS:**\n```\nbrew install ollama\n```\nOtherwise choose macOS installer from the [official website](https://ollama.com/).\n\n**On Linux:**\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n**Finding Model Names:**\nVisit the [Ollama model library](https://ollama.com/library) for a list of available models and their corresponding names.  The format is usually `provider/model-name` (or just `model-name` in some cases).\n\n#### Second step: pulling the model\n**On Windows, macOS, and Linux:**\n```\nollama pull <model-name>\n```\n\n1. Replace `<model-name>` with the name of the model you want to use.  For example, to pull the Mistral Large model, you would use the command `ollama pull mistral-large`.\n\n2. A CLI message should confirm the model download on your system\n\n#### Selecting your model within Agent Zero\n1. Once you've downloaded your model(s), you must select it in the Settings page of the GUI. \n\n2. Within the Chat model, Utility model, or Embedding model section, choose Ollama as provider.\n\n3. Write your model code as expected by Ollama, in the format `llama3.2` or `qwen2.5:7b`\n\n4. Click `Save` to confirm your settings.\n\n![ollama](res/setup/settings/4-local-models.png)\n\n#### Managing your downloaded models\nOnce you've downloaded some models, you might want to check which ones you have available or remove any you no longer need.\n\n- **Listing downloaded models:** \n  To see a list of all the models you've downloaded, use the command:\n  ```\n  ollama list\n  ```\n- **Removing a model:**\n  If you need to remove a downloaded model, you can use the `ollama rm` command followed by the model name:\n  ```\n  ollama rm <model-name>\n  ```\n\n\n- Experiment with different model combinations to find the balance of performance and cost that best suits your needs. E.g., faster and lower latency LLMs will help, and you can also use `faiss_gpu` instead of `faiss_cpu` for the memory.\n\n## Using Agent Zero on your mobile device\nAgent Zero's Web UI is accessible from any device on your network through the Docker container:\n\n1. The Docker container automatically exposes the Web UI on all network interfaces\n2. Find the mapped port in Docker Desktop:\n   - Look under the container name (usually in the format `<PORT>:80`)\n   - For example, if you see `32771:80`, your port is `32771`\n3. Access the Web UI from any device using:\n   - Local access: `http://localhost:<PORT>`\n   - Network access: `http://<YOUR_COMPUTER_IP>:<PORT>`\n\n> [!TIP]\n> - Your computer's IP address is usually in the format `192.168.x.x` or `10.0.x.x`\n> - You can find your external IP address by running `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux/Mac)\n> - The port is automatically assigned by Docker unless you specify one\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you're running Agent Zero directly on your system (legacy approach) instead of \n> using Docker, you'll need to configure the host manually in `run_ui.py` to run on all interfaces using `host=\"0.0.0.0\"`.\n\nFor developers or users who need to run Agent Zero directly on their system,see the [In-Depth Guide for Full Binaries Installation](#in-depth-guide-for-full-binaries-installation).\n\n# How to update Agent Zero\n\n1. **If you come from the previous version of Agent Zero:**\n- Your data is safely stored across various directories and files inside the Agent Zero folder.\n- To update to the new Docker runtime version, you might want to backup the following files and directories:\n  - `/memory` - Agent's memory\n  - `/knowledge` - Custom knowledge base (if you imported any custom knowledge files)\n  - `/instruments` - Custom instruments and functions (if you created any custom)\n  - `/tmp/settings.json` - Your Agent Zero settings\n  - `/tmp/chats/` - Your chat history\n- Once you have saved these files and directories, you can proceed with the Docker runtime [installation instructions above](#windows-macos-and-linux-setup-guide) setup guide.\n- Reach for the folder where you saved your data and copy it to the new Agent Zero folder set during the installation process.\n- Agent Zero will automatically detect your saved data and use it across memory, knowledge, instruments, prompts and settings.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> If you have issues loading your settings, you can try to delete the `/tmp/settings.json` file and let Agent Zero generate a new one.\n> The same goes for chats in `/tmp/chats/`, they might be incompatible with the new version\n\n2. **Update Process (Docker Desktop)**\n- Go to Docker Desktop and stop the container from the \"Containers\" tab\n- Right-click and select \"Remove\" to remove the container\n- Go to \"Images\" tab and remove the `frdel/agent-zero-run` image or click the three dots to pull the difference and update the Docker image.\n\n![docker delete image](res/setup/docker-delete-image-1.png)\n\n- Search and pull the new image if you chose to remove it\n- Run the new container with the same volume settings as the old one\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Make sure to use the same volume mount path when running the new\n> container to preserve your data. The exact path depends on where you stored\n> your Agent Zero data directory (the chosen directory on your machine).\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Alternatively, run the following commands in your terminal:\n>\n> ```bash\n> # Stop the current container\n> docker stop agent-zero\n>\n> # Remove the container (data is safe in the folder)\n> docker rm agent-zero\n>\n> # Remove the old image\n> docker rmi frdel/agent-zero-run\n>\n> # Pull the latest image\n> docker pull frdel/agent-zero-run\n>\n> # Run new container with the same volume mount\n> docker run -p $PORT:80 -v /path/to/your/data:/a0 frdel/agent-zero-run\n> ```\n\n3. **Full Binaries**\n- Using Git/GitHub: Pull the latest version of the Agent Zero repository. \n- The custom knowledge, solutions, memory, and other data will get ignored, so you don't need to worry about losing any of your custom data. The same goes for your .env file with all of your API keys and settings.json.\n\n> [!WARNING]  \n> - If you update manually, beware: save your .env file with the API keys, and look for new dependencies in requirements.txt. \n> - If any changes are made to the requirements of the updated version, you have to execute this command inside the a0 conda env after activating it:\n> ```bash\n> pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# In-Depth Guide for Full Binaries Installation\n- Agent Zero is a framework. It's made to be customized, edited, enhanced. Therefore you need to install the necessary components to run it when downloading its full binaries. This guide will help you to do so.\n- The following step by step instructions can be followed along with a video for this tutorial on how to make Agent Zero work with its full development environment.\n\n[![Video](res/setup/thumb_play.png)](https://youtu.be/8H7mFsvxKYQ)\n\n## Reminders:\n1. There's no need to install Python, Conda will manage that for you.\n2. You don't necessarily need API keys: Agent Zero can run with local models. For this tutorial though, we will leave it to the default OpenAI API. A guide for downloading Ollama along with local models is available [here](#installing-and-using-ollama-local-models).\n3. Visual Studio Code or any other code editor is not mandatory, but it makes it easier to navigate and edit files.\n4. Git/GitHub is not mandatory, you can download the framework files through your browser. We will not be showing how to use Git in this tutorial.\n5. Docker is not mandatory for the full binaries installation, since the framework will run on your machine connecting to the Docker container through the Web UI RFC functionality.\n6. Running Agent Zero without Docker makes the process more complicated and it's thought for developers and contributors.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> Linux instructions are provided as general instructions for any Linux distribution. If you're using a distribution other than Debian/Ubuntu, you may need to adjust the instructions accordingly.\n>\n> For Debian/Ubuntu, just follow the macOS instructions, as they are the same.\n\n## 1. Install Conda (miniconda)\n- Conda is a Python environment manager, it will help you keep your projects and installations separated. \n- It's a lightweight version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others.\n\n1. Go to the download page of miniconda [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#miniconda-latest-installer-links). If the link does not work, just search the web for \"miniconda download\".\n2. Based on your operating system, download the right installer of miniconda. For macOS select the version with \"pkg\" at the end.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-1.png\" alt=\"miniconda download win\" width=\"500\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-5.png\" alt=\"miniconda download macos\" width=\"500\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n3. Run the installer and go through the installation process, here you can leave everything to default and just click Next, Next... The same goes for macOS with the \"pkg\" graphical installer.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image.png\" alt=\"miniconda install\" width=\"200\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-2.png\" alt=\"miniconda install\" width=\"200\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-3.png\" alt=\"miniconda install\" width=\"200\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-4.png\" alt=\"miniconda install\" width=\"200\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n4. After the installation is complete, you should have \"Anaconda Powershell Prompt\" installed on your Windows machine. On macOS, when you open the Terminal application in your Applications folder and type \"conda --version\", you should see the version installed.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-6.png\" alt=\"miniconda installed\" height=\"100\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-7.png\" alt=\"miniconda installed\" height=\"100\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n\n## 2. Download Agent Zero\n- You can clone the Agent Zero repository (https://github.com/frdel/agent-zero) from GitHub if you know how to use Git. In this tutorial I will just show how to download the files.\n\n1. Go to the Agent Zero releases [here](https://github.com/frdel/agent-zero/releases).\n2. The latest release is on the top of the list, click the \"Source Code (zip)\" button under \"Assets\" to download it.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-14-u.png\" alt=\"agent zero download\" width=\"500\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n3. Extract the downloaded archive where you want to have it. I will extract them to \"agent-zero\" folder on my Desktop - \"C:\\Users\\frdel\\Desktop\\agent-zero\" on Windows and \"/Users/frdel/Desktop/agent-zero\" on macOS.\n\n## 3. Set up Conda environment\n- Now that we have the project files and Conda, we can create **virtual Python environment** for this project, activate it and install requirements.\n\n1. Open your **\"Anaconda Powershell Prompt\"** application on windows or **\"Terminal\"** application on macOS.\n2. In the terminal, navigate to your Agent Zero folder using **\"cd\"** command. Replace the path with your actual Agent Zero folder path.\n~~~\ncd C:\\Users\\frdel\\Desktop\\agent-zero\n~~~\nYou should see your folder has changed on the next terminal line.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-15.png\" alt=\"agent zero cd\" height=\"100\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-16.png\" alt=\"agent zero cd\" height=\"100\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n3. Create Conda environment using command **\"conda create\"**. After **\"-n\"** is your environment name, you can choose your own, i will use **\"a0\"** - short for Agent Zero. After **\"python\"** is the Python version that Conda will install for you into this environment, right now, 3.12 works fine. **-y** skips confirmations.\n~~~\nconda create -n a0 python=3.12 -y\n~~~\n\n4. Once done, activate the new environment for this terminal window by another command:\n~~~\nconda activate a0\n~~~\nAnd you should see that the **(base)** on the left has changed to **(a0)**. This means that this terminal now uses the new **a0** virtual environment and all packages will be installed into this environment.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-17.png\" alt=\"conda env\" height=\"200\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-18.png\" alt=\"conda env\" height=\"200\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> If you open a new terminal window, you will need to activate the environment with \n> \"conda activate a0\" again for that window.\n\n5. Install requirements using **\"pip\"**. Pip is a Python package manager. We can install all required packages from requirements.txt file using command:\n~~~\npip install -r requirements.txt\n~~~\nThis might take some time. If you get any errors regarding version conflicts and compatibility, double check that your environment is activated and that you created that environment with the correct Python version.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-19.png\" alt=\"conda reqs\" height=\"200\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n## 4. Install Docker (Docker Desktop application)\nSimply put, Docker is a way of running virtual computers on your machine. These are lightweight, disposable and isolated from your operating system, so it is a way to sandbox Agent Zero.\n- Agent Zero only connects to the Docker container when it needs to execute code and commands. The frameworks itself runs on your machine.\n- Docker has a desktop application with GUI for all major operating system, which is the recommended way to install it.\n\n1. Go to the download page of Docker Desktop [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). If the link does not work, just search the web for \"docker desktop download\".\n2. Download the version for your operating system. Don't be tricked by the seemingly missing windows intel/amd version, it's the button itself, not in the dropdown menu.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-8.png\" alt=\"docker download\" width=\"200\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n3. Run the installer and go through the installation process. It should be even shorter than Conda installation, you can leave everything to default. On macOS, the installer is a \"dmg\" image, so just drag and drop the application to your Applications folder like always.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-9.png\" alt=\"docker install\" width=\"300\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-10.png\" alt=\"docker install\" width=\"300\"/>\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-12.png\" alt=\"docker install\" width=\"300\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n\n4. Once installed, you should see Docker Desktop application on your Windows/Mac machine. \n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-11.png\" alt=\"docker installed\" height=\"100\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-13.png\" alt=\"docker installed\" height=\"100\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n5. Create account in the application.\n- It's required to be signed in to the Docker Hub, so create a free account in the Docker Desktop application, you will be prompted when the application first runs.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> **Important macOS-only Docker Configuration:** In Docker Desktop's preferences \n> (Docker menu) go to Settings, navigate to \"Advanced\" and check \"Allow the default \n> Docker socket to be used (requires password).\"  This allows Agent Zero to \n> communicate with the Docker daemon.\n\n![docker socket macOS](res/setup/macsocket.png)\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> **Linux Users:** You can install both Docker Desktop or docker-ce (Community Edition). \n> For Docker Desktop, follow the instructions for your specific Linux distribution [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/). \n> For docker-ce, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).\n>\n> If you're using docker-ce, you will need to add your user to the `docker` group to be able to run docker commands without sudo. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`. Then log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.\n>\n> Login in the Docker CLI with `docker login` and provide your Docker Hub credentials.\n\n6. Pull the Docker image\n- Agent Zero needs a Docker image to be pulled from the Docker Hub to be run, even when using the full binaries.\nYou can refer to the [installation instructions above](#windows-macos-and-linux-setup-guide) to run the Docker container and then resume from the next step. There are two differences:\n  - You need to map two ports instead of one:\n    - 55022 in the first field to run the Remote Function Call SSH\n    - 0 in the second field to run the Web UI in automatic port assignment\n  - You need to map the `/a0` volume to the location of your local Agent Zero folder.\n- Run the Docker container following the instructions.\n\n## 5. Run the local Agent Zero instance\nRun the Agent Zero with Web UI:\n~~~\npython run_ui.py\n~~~\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-21.png\" alt=\"run ui\" height=\"110\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n- Open the URL shown in terminal in your web browser. You should see the Agent Zero interface.\n\n## 6. Configure Agent Zero\nNow we can configure Agent Zero - select models, settings, API Keys etc. Refer to the [Usage](usage.md#agent-configuration) guide for a full guide on how to configure Agent Zero.\n\n## 7. Configure Agent Zero RFC\nAgent Zero needs to be configured further to redirect some functions to the Docker container. This is crucial for development as A0 needs to run in a standardized environment to support all features.\n1. Go in \"Settings\" page in the Web UI of your local instance and go in the \"Development\" section.\n2. Set \"RFC Destination URL\" to `http://localhost`\n3. Set the two ports (HTTP and SSH) to the ones used when creating the Docker container\n4. Click \"Save\"\n\n![rfc local settings](res/setup/9-rfc-devpage-on-local-sbs-1.png)\n\n5. Go in \"Settings\" page in the Web UI of your Docker instance and go in the \"Development\" section.\n\n![rfc docker settings](res/setup/9-rfc-devpage-on-docker-instance-1.png)\n\n6. This time the page has only the password field, set it to the same password you used when creating the Docker container.\n7. Click \"Save\"\n8. Use the Development environment\n9. Now you have the full development environment to work on Agent Zero.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-22-1.png\" alt=\"run ui\" width=\"400\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-23-1.png\" alt=\"run ui\" width=\"400\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n      \n### Conclusion\nAfter following the instructions for your specific operating system, you should have Agent Zero successfully installed and running. You can now start exploring the framework's capabilities and experimenting with creating your own intelligent agents. \n\nIf you encounter any issues during the installation process, please consult the [Troubleshooting section](troubleshooting.md) of this documentation or refer to the Agent Zero [Skool](https://www.skool.com/agent-zero) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/Z2tun2N3) community for assistance.\n\n"

        "content": "# Quick Start\nThis guide provides a quick introduction to using Agent Zero. We'll cover launching the web UI, starting a new chat, and running a simple task.\n\n## Launching the Web UI\n1. Make sure you have Agent Zero installed and your environment set up correctly (refer to the [Installation guide](installation.md) if needed).\n2. Open a terminal in the Agent Zero directory and activate your conda environment (if you're using one).\n3. Run the following command:\n\n```bash\npython run_ui.py\n```\n\n4.  A message similar to this will appear in your terminal, indicating the Web UI is running:\n\n![](res/flask_link.png)\n\n5. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://127.0.0.1:50001`). You should see the Agent Zero Web UI.\n\n![New Chat](res/ui_newchat1.png)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> As you can see, the Web UI has four distinct buttons for easy chat management: \n> `New Chat`, `Reset Chat`, `Save Chat`, and `Load Chat`.\n> Chats can be saved and loaded individually in `json` format and are stored in the\n> `/tmp/chats` directory.\n\n    ![Chat Management](res/ui_chat_management.png)\n\n## Running a Simple Task\nLet's ask Agent Zero to download a YouTube video. Here's how:\n\n1.  Type \"Download a YouTube video for me\" in the chat input field and press Enter or click the send button.\n\n2. Agent Zero will process your request.  You'll see its \"thoughts\" and the actions it takes displayed in the UI. It will find a default already existing solution, that implies using the `code_execution_tool` to run a simple Python script to perform the task.\n\n3. The agent will then ask you for the URL of the YouTube video you want to download.\n\n## Example Interaction\nHere's an example of what you might see in the Web UI at step 3:\n![1](res/image-24.png)\n\n## Next Steps\nNow that you've run a simple task, you can experiment with more complex requests. Try asking Agent Zero to:\n\n* Perform calculations\n* Search the web for information\n* Execute shell commands\n* Explore web development tasks\n* Create or modify files\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The [Usage Guide](usage.md) provides more in-depth information on using Agent \n> Zero's various features, including prompt engineering, tool usage, and multi-agent \n> cooperation."

How do I ask Agent Zero to work directly on my files or dirs?**\n-   Place the files/dirs in the `work_dir` directory. Agent Zero will be able to perform tasks on them. The `work_dir` directory is located in the root directory of the Docker Container.\n\n**2. When I input something in the chat, nothing happens. What's wrong?**\n-   Check if you have set up API keys in the Settings page. If not, the application will not be able to communicate with the endpoints it needs to run LLMs and to perform tasks.\n\n**3. How do I integrate open-source models with Agent Zero?**\nRefer to the [Choosing your LLMs](installation.md#installing-and-using-ollama-local-models) section of the documentation for detailed instructions and examples for configuring different LLMs. Local models can be run using Ollama or LM Studio.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Some LLM providers offer free usage of their APIs, for example Groq, Mistral or SambaNova.\n\n**6. How can I make Agent Zero retain memory between sessions?**\nRefer to the [How to update Agent Zero](installation.md#how-to-update-agent-zero) section of the documentation for instructions on how to update Agent Zero while retaining memory and data.\n\n**7. Where can I find more documentation or tutorials?**\n-   Join the Agent Zero [Skool](https://www.skool.com/agent-zero) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/Z2tun2N3) community for support and discussions.\n\n**8. How do I adjust API rate limits?**\nModify the `rate_limit_seconds` and `rate_limit_requests` parameters in the `AgentConfig` class within `initialize.py`.\n\n**9. My code_execution_tool doesn't work, what's wrong?**\n-   Ensure you have Docker installed and running.  If using Docker Desktop on macOS, grant it access to your project files in Docker Desktop's settings.  Check the [Installation guide](installation.md#4-install-docker-docker-desktop-application) for more details.\n-   Verify that the Docker image is updated.\n\n**10. Can Agent Zero interact with external APIs or services (e.g., WhatsApp)?**\nExtending Agent Zero to interact with external APIs is possible by creating custom tools or solutions. Refer to the documentation on creating them. \n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Installation**\n- **Docker Issues:** If Docker containers fail to start, consult the Docker documentation and verify your Docker installation and configuration.  On macOS, ensure you've granted Docker access to your project files in Docker Desktop's settings as described in the [Installation guide](installation.md#4-install-docker-docker-desktop-application).

        "content": "# Agent Zero Tunnel Feature\n\nThe tunnel feature in Agent Zero allows you to expose your local Agent Zero instance to the internet using Flaredantic tunnels. This makes it possible to share your Agent Zero instance with others without requiring them to install and run Agent Zero themselves.\n\n## How It Works\n\nAgent Zero uses the [Flaredantic](https://pypi.org/project/flaredantic/) library to create secure tunnels to expose your local instance to the internet. These tunnels:\n\n- Are secure (HTTPS)\n- Don't require any configuration\n- Generate unique URLs for each session\n- Can be regenerated on demand\n\n## Using the Tunnel Feature\n\n1. Open the settings and navigate to the \"External Services\" tab\n2. Click on \"Flare Tunnel\" in the navigation menu\n3. Click the \"Create Tunnel\" button to generate a new tunnel\n4. Once created, the tunnel URL will be displayed and can be copied to share with others\n5. The tunnel URL will remain active until you stop the tunnel or close the Agent Zero application\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nWhen sharing your Agent Zero instance via a tunnel:\n\n- Anyone with the URL can access your Agent Zero instance\n- No additional authentication is added beyond what your Agent Zero instance already has\n- Consider setting up authentication if you're sharing sensitive information\n- The tunnel exposes your local Agent Zero instance, not your entire system\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues with the tunnel feature:\n\n1. Check your internet connection\n2. Try refreshing the tunnel URL\n3. Restart Agent Zero\n4. Check the console logs for any error messages\n\n## Adding Authentication\n\nTo add basic authentication to your Agent Zero instance when using tunnels, you can set the following environment variables:\n\n```\nAUTH_LOGIN=your_username\nAUTH_PASSWORD=your_password\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure the username and password directly in the settings:\n\n1. Open the settings modal in the Agent Zero UI\n2. Navigate to the \"External Services\" tab\n3. Find the \"Authentication\" section\n4. Enter your desired username and password in the \"UI Login\" and \"UI Password\" fields\n5. Click the \"Save\" button to apply the changes\n\nThis will require users to enter these credentials when accessing your tunneled Agent Zero instance. When attempting to create a tunnel without authentication configured, Agent Zero will display a security warning."

The agent will handle them as a batch while keeping you informed of the progress.\n\n## Tool Usage\nAgent Zero's power comes from its ability to use [tools](architecture.md#tools). Here's how to leverage them effectively:\n\n- **Understand Tools:** Agent Zero includes default tools like knowledge (powered by SearXNG), webpage content, code execution, and communication. Understand the capabilities of these tools and how to invoke them.\n\n## Example of Tools Usage: Web Search and Code Execution\nLet's say you want Agent Zero to perform some financial analysis tasks. Here's a possible prompt:\n\n> Please be a professional financial analyst. Find last month Bitcoin/ USD price trend and make a chart in your environment. The chart must  have highlighted key points corresponding with dates of major news  about cryptocurrency. Use the 'knowledge_tool' to find the price and  the news, and the 'code_execution_tool' to perform the rest of the job.\n\nAgent Zero might then:\n\n1. Use the `knowledge_tool` to query a reliable source for the Bitcoin price and for the news about cryptocurrency as prompted.\n2. Extract the price from the search results and save the news, extracting their dates and possible impact on the price.\n3. Use the `code_execution_tool` to execute a Python script that performs the graph creation and key points highlighting, using the extracted data and the news dates as inputs.\n4. Return the final chart that you'll find in `/work_dir`, responding to the user with the `response_tool`.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The first run of `code_execution_tool` may take a while as it downloads and builds the Agent Zero Docker image. Subsequent runs will be faster.\n\nThis example demonstrates how to combine multiple tools to achieve an analysis task. By mastering prompt engineering and tool usage, you can unlock the full potential of Agent Zero to solve complex problems.\n\n## Multi-Agent Cooperation\nOne of Agent Zero's unique features is multi-agent cooperation.\n\n* **Creating Sub-Agents:** Agents can create sub-agents to delegate sub-tasks.  This helps manage complexity and distribute workload.\n* **Communication:** Agents can communicate with each other, sharing information and coordinating actions. The system prompt and message history play a key role in guiding this communication.\n* **Hierarchy:** Agent Zero uses a [hierarchical structure](architecture.md#agent-hierarchy-and-communication), with superior agents delegating tasks to subordinates.  This allows for structured problem-solving and efficient resource allocation.\n\n![](res/physics.png)\n![](res/physics-2.png)\n\n## Prompt Engineering\nEffective prompt engineering is crucial for getting the most out of Agent Zero. Here are some tips and techniques:\n\n* **Be Clear and Specific:** Clearly state your desired outcome.  The more specific you are, the better Agent Zero can understand and fulfill your request.  Avoid vague or ambiguous language.\n* **Provide Context:** If necessary, provide background information or context to help the agent understand the task better. This might include relevant details, constraints, or desired format for the response.\n* **Break Down Complex Tasks:**  For complex tasks, break them down into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.  This makes it easier for the agent to reason through the problem and generate a solution.\n* **Iterative Refinement:** Don't expect perfect results on the first try.  Experiment with different prompts, refine your instructions based on the agent's responses, and iterate until you achieve the desired outcome. To achieve a full-stack, web-app development task, for example, you might need to iterate for a few hours for 100% success.\n\n## Voice Interface\nAgent Zero provides both Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) capabilities for natural voice interaction:\n\n### Text-to-Speech\nEnable voice responses from agents:\n* Toggle the \"Speech\" switch in the Preferences section of the sidebar\n* Agents will use your system's built-in voice synthesizer to speak their messages\n* Click the \"Stop Speech\" button above the input area to immediately stop any ongoing speech\n\n![TTS Stop Speech](res/ui-tts-stop-speech.png)\n\n- The interface allows users to stop speech at any time if a response is too lengthy or if they wish to intervene during the conversation.\n\nThe TTS uses a standard voice interface provided by modern browsers, which may sound robotic but is effective and does not require complex AI models. This ensures low latency and quick responses across various platforms, including mobile devices.\n\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The Text-to-Speech feature is great for:\n> - Multitasking while receiving agent responses\n> - Accessibility purposes\n> - Creating a more interactive experience\n\n### Speech-to-Text\nSend voice messages to agents using OpenAI's Whisper model (does not require OpenAI API key!):\n\n1. Click the microphone button in the input area to start recording\n2. The button color indicates the current status:\n   - Grey: Inactive\n   - Red: Listening\n   - Green: Recording\n   - Teal: Waiting\n   - Cyan (pulsing): Processing\n\nUsers can adjust settings such as silence threshold and message duration before sending to optimize their interaction experience.\n\nConfigure STT settings in the Settings page:\n* **Model Size:** Choose between Base (74M, English) or other models\n  - Note: Only Large and Turbo models support multiple languages\n* **Language Code:** Set your preferred language (e.g., 'en', 'fr', 'it', 'cz')\n* **Silence Detection:**\n  - Threshold: Adjust sensitivity (lower values are more sensitive)\n  - Duration: Set how long silence should last before ending recording\n  - Timeout: Set maximum waiting time before closing the microphone\n\n![Speech to Text Settings](res/ui-settings-5-speech-to-text.png)\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> All STT and TTS functionalities operate locally within the Docker container, \n> ensuring that no data is transmitted to external servers or OpenAI APIs. This \n> enhances user privacy while maintaining functionality.\n\n### Mathematical Expressions\nAgent Zero supports KaTeX for beautiful mathematical typesetting:\n\n* **Inline Math:** Use single dollars `$...$` for inline expressions\n  - Example: Type `The area of a circle is $A = πr^2$`\n  - Renders as: The area of a circle is $A = πr^2$\n\n* **Display Math:** Use double dollars `$$...$$` for centered display equations\n  - Example: Type `$$F = G\\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$`\n  - Renders as a centered equation\n\n![KaTeX](res/ui-katex-1.png)\n\n* **Complex Mathematics:** Supports full KaTeX syntax for:\n  - Fractions, exponents, and roots\n  - Matrices and arrays\n  - Greek letters and mathematical symbols\n  - Integrals, summations, and limits\n  - Mathematical alignments and equations\n\n![KaTeX display](res/ui-katex-2.png)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> When asking the agent to solve mathematical problems, it will automatically respond using KaTeX formatting for clear and professional-looking mathematical expressions.\n\n### File Browser\nAgent Zero provides a powerful file browser interface for managing your workspace:\n\n#### Interface Overview\n- **Navigation Bar**: Shows current directory path with \"Up\" button for parent directory\n- **File List**: Displays files and directories with key information:\n  - Name (sortable)\n  - Size in bytes\n  - Last modified timestamp\n- **Action Icons**: Each file/directory has:\n  - Download button\n  - Delete button (with confirmation)\n\n![File Browser](res/ui-file-browser.png)\n\n#### Features\n- **Directory Navigation**: \n  - Click directories to enter them\n  - Use \"Up\" button to move to parent directory\n  - Current path always visible for context\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The files browser allows the user to go in the Agent Zero root folder if you click the `Up` button, but the working directory of Agents will always be `/work_dir`\n> \n- **File Operations**:\n  - Create new files and directories\n  - Delete existing files and directories\n  - Download files to your local system\n  - Upload files from your local system\n- **File Information**:\n  - Visual indicators for file types (folders, code files, documents)\n  - Size information in human-readable format\n  - Last modification timestamps\n- **Bulk Operations**:\n  - Upload multiple files simultaneously\n  - Select and manage multiple files at once\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The File Browser integrates seamlessly with Agent Zero's capabilities. You can reference files directly in your conversations, and the agent can help you manage, modify, and organize your files."

It is designed to be dynamic, organically growing, and learning as you use it.\n- Agent Zero is fully transparent, readable, comprehensible, customizable, and interactive.\n- Agent Zero uses the computer as a tool to accomplish its (your) tasks.\n\n# 💡 Key Features\n\n1. **General-purpose Assistant**\n\n- Agent Zero is not pre-programmed for specific tasks (but can be). It is meant to be a general-purpose personal assistant. Give it a task, and it will gather information, execute commands and code, cooperate with other agent instances, and do its best to accomplish it.\n- It has a persistent memory, allowing it to memorize previous solutions, code, facts, instructions, etc., to solve tasks faster and more reliably in the future.\n\n![Agent 0 Working](/docs/res/ui-screen-2.png)\n\n2. **Computer as a Tool**\n\n- Agent Zero uses the operating system as a tool to accomplish its tasks. It has no single-purpose tools pre-programmed. Instead, it can write its own code and use the terminal to create and use its own tools as needed.\n- The only default tools in its arsenal are online search, memory features, communication (with the user and other agents), and code/terminal execution. Everything else is created by the agent itself or can be extended by the user.\n- Tool usage functionality has been developed from scratch to be the most compatible and reliable, even with very small models.\n- **Default Tools:** Agent Zero includes tools like knowledge, webpage content, code execution, and communication.\n- **Creating Custom Tools:** Extend Agent Zero's functionality by creating your own custom tools.\n- **Instruments:** Instruments are a new type of tool that allow you to create custom functions and procedures that can be called by Agent Zero.\n\n3. **Multi-agent Cooperation**\n\n- Every agent has a superior agent giving it tasks and instructions. Every agent then reports back to its superior.\n- In the case of the first agent in the chain (Agent 0), the superior is the human user; the agent sees no difference.\n- Every agent can create its subordinate agent to help break down and solve subtasks. This helps all agents keep their context clean and focused.\n\n![Multi-agent](docs/res/physics.png)\n![Multi-agent 2](docs/res/physics-2.png)\n\n4. **Completely Customizable and Extensible**\n\n- Almost nothing in this framework is hard-coded. Nothing is hidden. Everything can be extended or changed by the user.\n- The whole behavior is defined by a system prompt in the **prompts/default/agent.system.md** file. Change this prompt and change the framework dramatically.\n- The framework does not guide or limit the agent in any way. There are no hard-coded rails that agents have to follow.\n- Every prompt, every small message template sent to the agent in its communication loop can be found in the **prompts/** folder and changed.\n- Every default tool can be found in the **python/tools/** folder and changed or copied to create new predefined tools.\n\n![Prompts](/docs/res/prompts.png)\n\n5. **Communication is Key**\n\n- Give your agent a proper system prompt and instructions, and it can do miracles.\n- Agents can communicate with their superiors and subordinates, asking questions, giving instructions, and providing guidance. Instruct your agents in the system prompt on how to communicate effectively.\n- The terminal interface is real-time streamed and interactive. You can stop and intervene at any point. If you see your agent heading in the wrong direction, just stop and tell it right away.\n- There is a lot of freedom in this framework. You can instruct your agents to regularly report back to superiors asking for permission to continue. You can instruct them to use point-scoring systems when deciding when to delegate subtasks. Superiors can double-check subordinates' results and dispute. The possibilities are endless.\n\n## 🚀 Things you can build with Agent Zero\n\n- **Development Projects** - `\"Create a React dashboard with real-time data visualization\"`\n\n- **Data Analysis** - `\"Analyze last quarter's NVIDIA sales data and create trend reports\"`\n\n- **Content Creation** - `\"Write a technical blog post about microservices\"`\n\n- **System Admin** - `\"Set up a monitoring system for our web servers\"`\n\n- **Research** - `\"Gather and summarize five recent AI papers about CoT prompting\"`\n\n# ⚙️ Installation\n\nClick to open a video to learn how to install Agent Zero:\n\n[![Testing Video](/docs/res/new_vid.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHDCCSr1YRI&t=24s)\n\nA detailed setup guide for Windows, macOS, and Linux with a video can be found in the Agent Zero Documentation at [this page](./docs/installation.md).\n\n### ⚡ Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Pull and run with Docker\n\ndocker pull frdel/agent-zero-run\ndocker run -p 50001:80 frdel/agent-zero-run\n\n# Visit http://localhost:50001 to start\n```\n\n- Developers and contributors: download the full binaries for your system from the [releases page](https://github.com/frdel/agent-zero/releases) and then follow the instructions [provided here](./docs/installation.md#in-depth-guide-for-full-binaries-installation).\n\n## 🐳 Fully Dockerized, with Speech-to-Text and TTS\n\n![Settings](docs/res/settings-page-ui.png)\n\n- Customizable settings allow users to tailor the agent's behavior and responses to their needs.\n- The Web UI output is very clean, fluid, colorful, readable, and interactive; nothing is hidden.\n- You can load or save chats directly within the Web UI.\n- The same output you see in the terminal is automatically saved to an HTML file in **logs/** folder for every session.\n\n![Time example](/docs/res/time_example.jpg)\n\n- Agent output is streamed in real-time, allowing users to read along and intervene at any time.\n- No coding is required; only prompting and communication skills are necessary.\n- With a solid system prompt, the framework is reliable even with small models, including precise tool usage.\n\n## 👀 Keep in Mind\n\n1. **Agent Zero Can Be Dangerous!**\n\n- With proper instruction, Agent Zero is capable of many things, even potentially dangerous actions concerning your computer, data, or accounts. Always run Agent Zero in an isolated environment (like Docker) and be careful what you wish for.\n\n2. **Agent Zero Is Not Pre-programmed; It Is Prompt-based.**\n\n- The whole framework contains only a minimal amount of code and does not guide the agent in any way. Everything lies in the system prompt located in the **prompts/** folder.\n\n3. **If You Cannot Provide the Ideal Environment, Let Your Agent Know.**\n\n- Agent Zero is made to be used in an isolated virtual environment (for safety) with some tools preinstalled and configured.\n\n### 📌 Known Problems\n\n1. The system prompt may need improvements; contributions are welcome!\n2. The agent may inadvertently alter its operating environment; cleaning up the `work_dir` often fixes this.\n3. Agents might loop in multi-agentic interactions, leading to unexpected behaviors.\n\n## 📚 Read the Documentation\n\n| Page | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [Installation](./docs/installation.md) | Installation, setup and configuration |\n| [Usage](./docs/usage.md) | Basic and advanced usage |\n| [Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) | System design and components |\n| [Contributing](./docs/contributing.md) | How to contribute |\n| [Troubleshooting](./docs/troubleshooting.md) | Common issues and their solutions |\n\n## 🎯 Changelog\n\n### Coming soon\n\n- **User Interaction Refinements**\n- **Browser Use and RAG Tools**\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>\n>**Changes to frdel/agent-zero Docker image since v0.7:**\n>\n> The new Docker image `frdel/agent-zero-run` provides the new unified environment.\n\n### v0.8\n\n- **Docker Runtime**\n- **New Messages History and Summarization System**\n- **Agent Behavior Change and Management**\n- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT)**\n- **Settings Page in Web UI**\n- **SearXNG Integration Replacing Perplexity + DuckDuckGo**\n- **File Browser Functionality**\n- **KaTeX Math Visualization Support**\n- **In-chat File Attachments**\n\n### v0.7\n\n- **Automatic Memory**\n- **UI Improvements**\n- **Instruments**\n- **Extensions Framework**\n- **Reflection Prompts**\n- **Bug Fixes**\n\n## 🤝 Community and Support\n\n- [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/B8KZKNsPpj) for live discussions or [visit our Skool Community](https://www.skool.com/agent-zero).\n- [Follow our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AgentZeroFW) for hands-on explanations and tutorials\n- [Report Issues](https://github.com/frdel/agent-zero/issues) for bug fixes and features\n"

Access the Web UI:\n- The framework will take a few seconds to initialize and the Docker logs will look like the image below.\n- Find the mapped port in Docker Desktop (shown as `<PORT>:80`) or click the port right under the container ID as shown in the image below\n\n![docker logs](res/setup/5-docker-click-to-open.png)\n\n- Open `http://localhost:<PORT>` in your browser\n- The Web UI will open. Agent Zero is ready for configuration!\n\n![docker ui](res/setup/6-docker-a0-running.png)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> You can also access the Web UI by clicking the ports right under the container ID in Docker Desktop.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> After starting the container, you'll find all Agent Zero files in your chosen \n> directory. You can access and edit these files directly on your machine, and \n> the changes will be immediately reflected in the running container.\n\n3. Configure Agent Zero\n- Refer to the following sections for a full guide on how to configure Agent Zero.\n\n## Settings Configuration\nAgent Zero provides a comprehensive settings interface to customize various aspects of its functionality. Access the settings by clicking the \"Settings\"button with a gear icon in the sidebar.\n\n### Agent Configuration\n- **Prompts Subdirectory:** Choose the subdirectory within `/prompts` for agent behavior customization. The 'default' directory contains the standard prompts.\n- **Memory Subdirectory:** Select the subdirectory for agent memory storage, allowing separation between different instances.\n- **Knowledge Subdirectory:** Specify the location of custom knowledge files to enhance the agent's understanding.\n\n![settings](res/setup/settings/1-agentConfig.png)\n\n### Chat Model Settings\n- **Provider:** Select the chat model provider (e.g., Ollama)\n- **Model Name:** Choose the specific model (e.g., llama3.2)\n- **Temperature:** Adjust response randomness (0 for deterministic, higher values for more creative responses)\n- **Context Length:** Set the maximum token limit for context window\n- **Context Window Space:** Configure how much of the context window is dedicated to chat history\n\n![chat model settings](res/setup/settings/2-chat-model.png)\n\n### Utility Model Configuration\n- **Provider & Model:** Select a smaller, faster model for utility tasks like memory organization and summarization\n- **Temperature:** Adjust the determinism of utility responses\n\n### Embedding Model Settings\n- **Provider:** Choose the embedding model provider (e.g., OpenAI)\n- **Model Name:** Select the specific embedding model (e.g., text-embedding-3-small)\n\n### Speech to Text Options\n- **Model Size:** Choose the speech recognition model size\n- **Language Code:** Set the primary language for voice recognition\n- **Silence Settings:** Configure silence threshold, duration, and timeout parameters for voice input\n\n### API Keys\n- Configure API keys for various service providers directly within the Web UI\n- Click `Save` to confirm your settings\n\n### Authentication\n- **UI Login:** Set username for web interface access\n- **UI Password:** Configure password for web interface security\n- **Root Password:** Manage Docker container root password for SSH access\n\n![settings](res/setup/settings/3-auth.png)\n\n### Development Settings\n- **RFC Parameters (local instances only):** configure URLs and ports for remote function calls between instances\n- **RFC Password:** Configure password for remote function calls\nLearn more about Remote Function Calls and their purpose [here](#7-configure-agent-zero-rfc).\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Always keep your API keys and passwords secure.\n\n# Choosing Your LLMs\nThe Settings page is the control center for selecting the Large Language Models (LLMs) that power Agent Zero.  You can choose different LLMs for different roles:\n\n| LLM Role | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `chat_llm` | This is the primary LLM used for conversations and generating responses. |\n| `utility_llm` | This LLM handles internal tasks like summarizing messages, managing memory, and processing internal prompts.  Using a smaller, less expensive model here can improve efficiency. |\n| `embedding_llm` | This LLM is responsible for generating embeddings used for memory retrieval and knowledge base lookups. Changing the `embedding_llm` will re-index all of A0's memory. |\n\n**How to Change:**\n1. Open Settings page in the Web UI.\n2. Choose the provider for the LLM for each role (Chat model, Utility model, Embedding model) and write the model name.\n3. Click \"Save\" to apply the changes.\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Changing the `embedding_llm` will re-index all the memory and knowledge, and \n> requires clearing the `memory` folder to avoid errors, as the embeddings can't be \n> mixed in the vector database. Note that this will DELETE ALL of Agent Zero's memory.\n\n## Installing and Using Ollama (Local Models)\nIf you're interested in Ollama, which is a powerful tool that allows you to run various large language models locally, here's how to install and use it:\n\n#### First step: installation\n**On Windows:**\n\nDownload Ollama from the official website and install it on your machine.\n\n<button>[Download Ollama Setup](https://ollama.com/download/OllamaSetup.exe)</button>\n\n**On macOS:**\n```\nbrew install ollama\n```\nOtherwise choose macOS installer from the [official website](https://ollama.com/).\n\n**On Linux:**\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n**Finding Model Names:**\nVisit the [Ollama model library](https://ollama.com/library) for a list of available models and their corresponding names.  The format is usually `provider/model-name` (or just `model-name` in some cases).\n\n#### Second step: pulling the model\n**On Windows, macOS, and Linux:**\n```\nollama pull <model-name>\n```\n\n1. Replace `<model-name>` with the name of the model you want to use.  For example, to pull the Mistral Large model, you would use the command `ollama pull mistral-large`.\n\n2. A CLI message should confirm the model download on your system\n\n#### Selecting your model within Agent Zero\n1. Once you've downloaded your model(s), you must select it in the Settings page of the GUI. \n\n2. Within the Chat model, Utility model, or Embedding model section, choose Ollama as provider.\n\n3. Write your model code as expected by Ollama, in the format `llama3.2` or `qwen2.5:7b`\n\n4. Click `Save` to confirm your settings.\n\n![ollama](res/setup/settings/4-local-models.png)\n\n#### Managing your downloaded models\nOnce you've downloaded some models, you might want to check which ones you have available or remove any you no longer need.\n\n- **Listing downloaded models:** \n  To see a list of all the models you've downloaded, use the command:\n  ```\n  ollama list\n  ```\n- **Removing a model:**\n  If you need to remove a downloaded model, you can use the `ollama rm` command followed by the model name:\n  ```\n  ollama rm <model-name>\n  ```\n\n\n- Experiment with different model combinations to find the balance of performance and cost that best suits your needs. E.g., faster and lower latency LLMs will help, and you can also use `faiss_gpu` instead of `faiss_cpu` for the memory.\n\n## Using Agent Zero on your mobile device\nAgent Zero's Web UI is accessible from any device on your network through the Docker container:\n\n1. The Docker container automatically exposes the Web UI on all network interfaces\n2. Find the mapped port in Docker Desktop:\n   - Look under the container name (usually in the format `<PORT>:80`)\n   - For example, if you see `32771:80`, your port is `32771`\n3. Access the Web UI from any device using:\n   - Local access: `http://localhost:<PORT>`\n   - Network access: `http://<YOUR_COMPUTER_IP>:<PORT>`\n\n> [!TIP]\n> - Your computer's IP address is usually in the format `192.168.x.x` or `10.0.x.x`\n> - You can find your external IP address by running `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux/Mac)\n> - The port is automatically assigned by Docker unless you specify one\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you're running Agent Zero directly on your system (legacy approach) instead of \n> using Docker, you'll need to configure the host manually in `run_ui.py` to run on all interfaces using `host=\"0.0.0.0\"`.\n\nFor developers or users who need to run Agent Zero directly on their system,see the [In-Depth Guide for Full Binaries Installation](#in-depth-guide-for-full-binaries-installation).\n\n# How to update Agent Zero\n\n1. **If you come from the previous version of Agent Zero (pre-0.7.1):**\n- Your data is safely stored across various directories and files inside the Agent Zero folder.\n- To update to the new Docker runtime version, you need to save the following files and directories:\n  - `/memory` - Agent's memory\n  - `/knowledge` - Custom knowledge base\n  - `/instruments` - Custom instruments and functions\n  - `/prompts` - Custom prompts files (if any has been created)\n  - `/work_dir` - Working directory\n  - `.env` - Your API keys\n  - `/tmp/settings.json` - Your Agent Zero settings\n- Once you have saved these files and directories, you can proceed with the Docker runtime [installation instructions above](#windows-macos-and-linux-setup-guide) setup guide.\n- Reach for the folder where you saved your data and copy it to the new Agent Zero folder set during the installation process.\n- Agent Zero will automatically detect your saved data and use it across memory, knowledge, instruments, prompts and settings.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Make sure to use the same embedding model you were using before, otherwise \n> you will have to re-index all of Agent Zero's memory, therefore deleting all \n> your custom knowledge and memory.\n>\n> If you have issues loading your settings, you can try to delete the `/tmp/settings.json` \n> file and let Agent Zero generate a new one.\n\n2. **Update Process (Docker Desktop)**\n- Go to Docker Desktop and stop the container from the \"Containers\" tab\n- Right-click and select \"Remove\" to remove the container\n- Go to \"Images\" tab and remove the `frdel/agent-zero-run` image or click the three dots to pull the difference and update the Docker image.\n\n![docker delete image](res/setup/docker-delete-image-1.png)\n\n- Search and pull the new image if you chose to remove it\n- Run the new container with the same volume settings as the old one\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Make sure to use the same volume mount path when running the new\n> container to preserve your data. The exact path depends on where you stored\n> your Agent Zero data directory (the chosen directory on your machine).\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Alternatively, run the following commands in your terminal:\n>\n> ```bash\n> # Stop the current container\n> docker stop agent-zero\n>\n> # Remove the container (data is safe in the folder)\n> docker rm agent-zero\n>\n> # Remove the old image\n> docker rmi frdel/agent-zero-run\n>\n> # Pull the latest image\n> docker pull frdel/agent-zero-run\n>\n> # Run new container with the same volume mount\n> docker run -p $PORT:80 -v /path/to/your/data:/a0 frdel/agent-zero-run\n> ```\n\n3. **Full Binaries**\n- Using Git/GitHub: Pull the latest version of the Agent Zero repository. \n- The custom knowledge, solutions, memory, and other data will get ignored, so you don't need to worry about losing any of your custom data. The same goes for your .env file with all of your API keys and settings.json.\n\n> [!WARNING]  \n> - If you update manually, beware: save your .env file with the API keys, and look for new dependencies in requirements.txt. \n> - If any changes are made to the requirements of the updated version, you have to execute this command inside the a0 conda env after activating it:\n> ```bash\n> pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# In-Depth Guide for Full Binaries Installation\n- Agent Zero is a framework. It's made to be customized, edited, enhanced. Therefore you need to install the necessary components to run it when downloading its full binaries. This guide will help you to do so.\n- The following step by step instructions can be followed along with a video for this tutorial on how to make Agent Zero work with its full development environment.\n\n[![Video](res/setup/thumb_play.png)](https://youtu.be/8H7mFsvxKYQ)\n\n## Reminders:\n1. There's no need to install Python, Conda will manage that for you.\n2. You don't necessarily need API keys: Agent Zero can run with local models. For this tutorial though, we will leave it to the default OpenAI API. A guide for downloading Ollama along with local models is available [here](#installing-and-using-ollama-local-models).\n3. Visual Studio Code or any other code editor is not mandatory, but it makes it easier to navigate and edit files.\n4. Git/GitHub is not mandatory, you can download the framework files through your browser. We will not be showing how to use Git in this tutorial.\n5. Docker is not mandatory for the full binaries installation, since the framework will run on your machine connecting to the Docker container through the Web UI RFC functionality.\n6. Running Agent Zero without Docker makes the process more complicated and it's thought for developers and contributors.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> Linux instructions are provided as general instructions for any Linux distribution. If you're using a distribution other than Debian/Ubuntu, you may need to adjust the instructions accordingly.\n>\n> For Debian/Ubuntu, just follow the macOS instructions, as they are the same.\n\n## 1. Install Conda (miniconda)\n- Conda is a Python environment manager, it will help you keep your projects and installations separated. \n- It's a lightweight version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others.\n\n1. Go to the download page of miniconda [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#miniconda-latest-installer-links). If the link does not work, just search the web for \"miniconda download\".\n2. Based on your operating system, download the right installer of miniconda. For macOS select the version with \"pkg\" at the end.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-1.png\" alt=\"miniconda download win\" width=\"500\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-5.png\" alt=\"miniconda download macos\" width=\"500\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n3. Run the installer and go through the installation process, here you can leave everything to default and just click Next, Next... The same goes for macOS with the \"pkg\" graphical installer.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image.png\" alt=\"miniconda install\" width=\"200\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-2.png\" alt=\"miniconda install\" width=\"200\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-3.png\" alt=\"miniconda install\" width=\"200\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-4.png\" alt=\"miniconda install\" width=\"200\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n4. After the installation is complete, you should have \"Anaconda Powershell Prompt\" installed on your Windows machine. On macOS, when you open the Terminal application in your Applications folder and type \"conda --version\", you should see the version installed.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-6.png\" alt=\"miniconda installed\" height=\"100\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-7.png\" alt=\"miniconda installed\" height=\"100\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n\n## 2. Download Agent Zero\n- You can clone the Agent Zero repository (https://github.com/frdel/agent-zero) from GitHub if you know how to use Git. In this tutorial I will just show how to download the files.\n\n1. Go to the Agent Zero releases [here](https://github.com/frdel/agent-zero/releases).\n2. The latest release is on the top of the list, click the \"Source Code (zip)\" button under \"Assets\" to download it.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-14-u.png\" alt=\"agent zero download\" width=\"500\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n3. Extract the downloaded archive where you want to have it. I will extract them to \"agent-zero\" folder on my Desktop - \"C:\\Users\\frdel\\Desktop\\agent-zero\" on Windows and \"/Users/frdel/Desktop/agent-zero\" on macOS.\n\n## 3. Set up Conda environment\n- Now that we have the project files and Conda, we can create **virtual Python environment** for this project, activate it and install requirements.\n\n1. Open your **\"Anaconda Powershell Prompt\"** application on windows or **\"Terminal\"** application on macOS.\n2. In the terminal, navigate to your Agent Zero folder using **\"cd\"** command. Replace the path with your actual Agent Zero folder path.\n~~~\ncd C:\\Users\\frdel\\Desktop\\agent-zero\n~~~\nYou should see your folder has changed on the next terminal line.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-15.png\" alt=\"agent zero cd\" height=\"100\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-16.png\" alt=\"agent zero cd\" height=\"100\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n3. Create Conda environment using command **\"conda create\"**. After **\"-n\"** is your environment name, you can choose your own, i will use **\"a0\"** - short for Agent Zero. After **\"python\"** is the Python version that Conda will install for you into this environment, right now, 3.12 works fine. **-y** skips confirmations.\n~~~\nconda create -n a0 python=3.12 -y\n~~~\n\n4. Once done, activate the new environment for this terminal window by another command:\n~~~\nconda activate a0\n~~~\nAnd you should see that the **(base)** on the left has changed to **(a0)**. This means that this terminal now uses the new **a0** virtual environment and all packages will be installed into this environment.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-17.png\" alt=\"conda env\" height=\"200\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-18.png\" alt=\"conda env\" height=\"200\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> If you open a new terminal window, you will need to activate the environment with \n> \"conda activate a0\" again for that window.\n\n5. Install requirements using **\"pip\"**. Pip is a Python package manager. We can install all required packages from requirements.txt file using command:\n~~~\npip install -r requirements.txt\n~~~\nThis might take some time. If you get any errors regarding version conflicts and compatibility, double check that your environment is activated and that you created that environment with the correct Python version.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-19.png\" alt=\"conda reqs\" height=\"200\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n## 4. Install Docker (Docker Desktop application)\nSimply put, Docker is a way of running virtual computers on your machine. These are lightweight, disposable and isolated from your operating system, so it is a way to sandbox Agent Zero.\n- Agent Zero only connects to the Docker container when it needs to execute code and commands. The frameworks itself runs on your machine.\n- Docker has a desktop application with GUI for all major operating system, which is the recommended way to install it.\n\n1. Go to the download page of Docker Desktop [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). If the link does not work, just search the web for \"docker desktop download\".\n2. Download the version for your operating system. Don't be tricked by the seemingly missing windows intel/amd version, it's the button itself, not in the dropdown menu.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-8.png\" alt=\"docker download\" width=\"200\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n3. Run the installer and go through the installation process. It should be even shorter than Conda installation, you can leave everything to default. On macOS, the installer is a \"dmg\" image, so just drag and drop the application to your Applications folder like always.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-9.png\" alt=\"docker install\" width=\"300\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-10.png\" alt=\"docker install\" width=\"300\"/>\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-12.png\" alt=\"docker install\" width=\"300\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n\n4. Once installed, you should see Docker Desktop application on your Windows/Mac machine. \n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-11.png\" alt=\"docker installed\" height=\"100\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-13.png\" alt=\"docker installed\" height=\"100\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n5. Create account in the application.\n- It's required to be signed in to the Docker Hub, so create a free account in the Docker Desktop application, you will be prompted when the application first runs.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> **Important macOS-only Docker Configuration:** In Docker Desktop's preferences \n> (Docker menu) go to Settings, navigate to \"Advanced\" and check \"Allow the default \n> Docker socket to be used (requires password).\"  This allows Agent Zero to \n> communicate with the Docker daemon.\n\n![docker socket macOS](res/setup/macsocket.png)\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> **Linux Users:** You can install both Docker Desktop or docker-ce (Community Edition). \n> For Docker Desktop, follow the instructions for your specific Linux distribution [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/). \n> For docker-ce, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).\n>\n> If you're using docker-ce, you will need to add your user to the `docker` group to be able to run docker commands without sudo. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`. Then log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.\n>\n> Login in the Docker CLI with `docker login` and provide your Docker Hub credentials.\n\n6. Pull the Docker image\n- Agent Zero needs a Docker image to be pulled from the Docker Hub to be run, even when using the full binaries.\nYou can refer to the [installation instructions above](#windows-macos-and-linux-setup-guide) to run the Docker container and then resume from the next step. There are two differences:\n  - You need to map two ports instead of one:\n    - 55022 in the first field to run the Remote Function Call SSH\n    - 0 in the second field to run the Web UI in automatic port assignment\n  - You need to map the `/a0` volume to the location of your local Agent Zero folder.\n- Run the Docker container following the instructions.\n\n## 5. Run the local Agent Zero instance\nRun the Agent Zero with Web UI:\n~~~\npython run_ui.py\n~~~\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-21.png\" alt=\"run ui\" height=\"110\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n- Open the URL shown in terminal in your web browser. You should see the Agent Zero interface.\n\n## 6. Configure Agent Zero\nNow we can configure Agent Zero - select models, settings, API Keys etc. Refer to the [Usage](usage.md#agent-configuration) guide for a full guide on how to configure Agent Zero.\n\n## 7. Configure Agent Zero RFC\nAgent Zero needs to be configured further to redirect some functions to the Docker container. This is crucial for development as A0 needs to run in a standardized environment to support all features.\n1. Go in \"Settings\" page in the Web UI of your local instance and go in the \"Development\" section.\n2. Set \"RFC Destination URL\" to `http://localhost`\n3. Set the two ports (HTTP and SSH) to the ones used when creating the Docker container\n4. Click \"Save\"\n\n![rfc local settings](res/setup/9-rfc-devpage-on-local-sbs-1.png)\n\n5. Go in \"Settings\" page in the Web UI of your Docker instance and go in the \"Development\" section.\n\n![rfc docker settings](res/setup/9-rfc-devpage-on-docker-instance-1.png)\n\n6. This time the page has only the password field, set it to the same password you used when creating the Docker container.\n7. Click \"Save\"\n8. Use the Development environment\n9. Now you have the full development environment to work on Agent Zero.\n\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-22-1.png\" alt=\"run ui\" width=\"400\"/>\n<img src=\"res/setup/image-23-1.png\" alt=\"run ui\" width=\"400\"/>\n<br><br>\n\n      \n### Conclusion\nAfter following the instructions for your specific operating system, you should have Agent Zero successfully installed and running. You can now start exploring the framework's capabilities and experimenting with creating your own intelligent agents. \n\nIf you encounter any issues during the installation process, please consult the [Troubleshooting section](troubleshooting.md) of this documentation or refer to the Agent Zero [Skool](https://www.skool.com/agent-zero) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/Z2tun2N3) community for assistance.\n\n"

        "content": "## Task Scheduler Subsystem:\nThe task scheduler is a part of agent-zero enabling the system to execute\narbitrary tasks defined by a \"system prompt\" and \"user prompt\".\n\nWhen the task is executed the prompts are being run in the background in a context\nconversation with the goal of completing the task described in the prompts.\n\nDedicated context means the task will run in it's own chat. If task is created without the\ndedicated_context flag then the task will run in the chat it was created in including entire history.\n\nThere are manual and automatically executed tasks.\nAutomatic execution happens by a schedule defined when creating the task.\n\nTasks are run asynchronously. If you need to wait for a running task's completion or need the result of the last task run, use the scheduler:wait_for_task tool. It will wait for the task completion in case the task is currently running and will provide the result of the last execution.\n\n### Important instructions\nWhen a task is scheduled or planned, do not manually run it, if you have no more tasks, respond to user.\nBe careful not to create recursive prompt, do not send a message that would make the agent schedule more tasks, no need to mention the interval in message, just the objective.\n!!! When the user asks you to execute a task, first check if the task already exists and do not create a new task for execution. Execute the existing task instead. If the task in question does not exist ask the user what action to take. Never create tasks if asked to execute a task.\n\n### Types of scheduler tasks\nThere are 3 types of scheduler tasks:\n\n#### Scheduled - type=\"scheduled\"\nThis type of task is run by a recurring schedule defined in the crontab syntax with 5 fields (ex. */5 * * * * means every 5 minutes).\nIt is recurring and started automatically when the crontab syntax requires next execution..\n\n#### Planned - type=\"planned\"\nThis type of task is run by a linear schedule defined as discrete datetimes of the upcoming executions.\nIt is  started automatically when a scheduled time elapses.\n\n#### AdHoc - type=\"adhoc\"\nThis type of task is run manually and does not follow any schedule. It can be run explicitly by \"scheduler:run_task\" agent tool or by the user in the UI.\n\n### Tools to manage the task scheduler system and it's tasks\n\n#### scheduler:list_tasks\nList all tasks present in the system with their 'uuid', 'name', 'type', 'state', 'schedule' and 'next_run'.\nAll runnable tasks can be listed and filtered here. The arguments are filter fields.\n\n##### Arguments:\n* state: list(str) (Optional) - The state filter, one of \"idle\", \"running\", \"disabled\", \"error\". To only show tasks in given state.\n* type: list(str) (Optional) - The task type filter, one of \"adhoc\", \"planned\", \"scheduled\"\n* next_run_within: int (Optional) - The next run of the task must be within this many minutes\n* next_run_after: int (Optional) - The next run of the task must be after not less than this many minutes\n\n##### Usage:\n~~~json\n{\n    \"thoughts\": [\n        \"I must look for planned runnable tasks with name ... and state idle or error\",\n        \"The tasks should run within next 20 minutes\"\n    ],\n    \"tool_name\": \"scheduler:list_tasks\",\n    \"tool_args\": {\n        \"state\": [\"idle\", \"error\"],\n        \"type\": [\"planned\"],\n        \"next_run_within\": 20\n    }\n}\n~~~\n\n\n#### scheduler:find_task_by_name\nList all tasks whose name is matching partially or fully the provided name parameter.\n\n##### Arguments:\n* name: str - The task name to look for\n\n##### Usage:\n~~~json\n{\n    \"thoughts\": [\n        \"I must look for tasks with name XYZ\"\n    ],\n    \"tool_name\": \"scheduler:find_task_by_name\",\n    \"tool_args\": {\n        \"name\": \"XYZ\"\n    }\n}\n~~~\n\n\n#### scheduler:show_task\nShow task details for scheduler task with the given uuid.\n\n##### Arguments:\n* uuid: string - The uuid of the task to display\n\n##### Usage (execute task with uuid \"xyz-123\"):\n~~~json\n{\n    \"thoughts\": [\n        \"I need details of task xxx-yyy-zzz\",\n    ],\n    \"tool_name\": \"scheduler:show_task\",\n    \"tool_args\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"xxx-yyy-zzz\",\n    }\n}\n~~~\n\n\n#### scheduler:run_task\nExecute a task manually which is not in \"running\" state\nThis can be used to trigger tasks manually.\nNormally you should only \"run\" tasks manually if they are in the \"idle\" state.\nIt is also advised to only run \"adhoc\" tasks manually but every task type can be triggered by this tool.\nYou can pass input data in text form as the \"context\" argument. The context will then be prepended to the task prompt when executed. This way you can pass for example result of one task as the input of another task or provide additional information specific to this one task run.\n\n##### Arguments:\n* uuid: string - The uuid of the task to run. Can be retrieved for example from \"scheduler:tasks_list\"\n* context: (Optional) string - The context that will be prepended to the actual task prompt as contextual information.\n\n##### Usage (execute task with uuid \"xyz-123\"):\n~~~json\n{\n    \"thoughts\": [\n        \"I must run task xyz-123\",\n    ],\n    \"tool_name\": \"scheduler:run_task\",\n    \"tool_args\": {\n        \"uuid\": \"xyz-123\",\n        \"context\": \"This text is useful to execute the task more precisely\"\n    }\n}\n~~~\n\n\n#### scheduler:delete_task\nDelete the task defined by the given uuid from the system.\n\n##### Arguments:\n* uuid: string - The uuid of the task to run.

        "body": "Implementing **Docker Persistent Storage** would enhance the flexibility of Agent Zero by ensuring consistent data availability across restarts, upgrades, and host migrations. Using a single command, Docker can **create and use the storage** if it doesn’t already exist, providing a seamless experience.\n\n### **Key Benefits:**\n✅ **Automatic Storage Handling** – A single command ensures persistent storage creation and usage.  \n✅ **Data Persistence Across Upgrades** – No need to migrate data manually when updating Agent Zero.  \n✅ **Easy Backup & Restore** – Docker volumes allow structured backups with simple commands.  \n✅ **Seamless Host Integration** – Moving data from container to host is straightforward.  \n\n### **Proposed Implementation:**  \nUsing **Docker Volumes**, the persistent storage can be created dynamically:\n```sh\ndocker run -d --name agentzero -v agent_zero_data:/a0 agent_zero_image\n```\n- If `agent_zero_data` **does not exist**, Docker **automatically creates it**.\n- The data is stored inside `/a0` within the container, making it accessible across sessions.\n\n### **Backup & Migration Options:**  \nTo **backup** the persistent volume:\n```sh\ndocker run --rm -v agent_zero_data:/a0 -v $(pwd):/backup busybox tar -czf /backup/agent_zero_backup.tar.gz /a0\n```\nTo **restore** data:\n```sh\ndocker run --rm -v agent_zero_data:/a0 -v $(pwd):/backup busybox tar -xzf /backup/agent_zero_backup.tar.gz -C /a0\n```\nThis ensures **data integrity when upgrading, migrating, or moving workflows**.\n\n### **Conclusion:**  \nBy integrating **Docker Persistent Storage**, Agent Zero can provide a **reliable**, **scalable**, and **user-friendly** workflow environment. \n\n",

DockerfileCuda also added for Nvidia GPU acceleration within the system along with MCP integration.\r\n    *   Enhanced MCP tool interactions by providing **contextual reminders** in the agent's history. This includes details of the original tool call, the related user prompt, and suggested next steps to help agents maintain context, especially with potentially long or complex MCP tool outputs.\r\n    *   Renamed `mcp.py` to `python/helpers/mcp_handler.py` to avoid potential namespace conflicts with the `mcp` library.\r\n"
